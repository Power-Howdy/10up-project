### Words to 10up Recruiting Team

Dear Sir/Madam,

üôÇ I am really happy that you gave me this opportunity to display my skills.
In response to your request, I have developed this project within 48 hours. 
First of all, I would like to apologize as this is not a fully completed project. üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Due to time constraints, I have implemented only the basic features. 
I utilized Next.js with Typescript for the development. 
To simplify state management, I chose to use Redux Thunk. 
In the Redux Thunk section, I incorporated data fetching asynchronously. 
I made an effort to keep the components as small as possible by splitting them. 
Additionally, I utilized various React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and some customized hooks.
To ensure code quality, I included automated testing scripts using Cypress, covering both end-to-end and component-based unit testing. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I hope that my work meets your requirements. 
Best Regards,
Edmond Vitel
