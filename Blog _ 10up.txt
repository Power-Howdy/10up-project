<p>On Monday, June 26th, I’ll be presenting at Boston’s WordPress Meetup on ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) can integrate with WordPress. The presentation, “You Got Your AI In My WP: WordPress and Artificial Intelligence”, will explore a few tools available that utilize AI to assist content creators on WordPress — including 10up’s own <a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a> and Jetpack’s <a href="https://jetpack.com/ai/">AI Assistant</a>.</p>
<p>The Boston WordPress Meetup is free to attend (registration required) and starts at 6:30 PM with a networking hour. If you’re in the Boston area, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boston-wordpress-meetup/events/lwwwdtyfcjbjc/">sign up here</a> — I’d love to see you there.</p>

<p>On March 29, WordPress released its first major update of 2023, <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/dolphy/">WordPress 6.2</a> (“Dolphy”)</strong>, with major improvements to the site editor experience. “Dolphy” also marks a shift in WordPress’ trajectory, with future releases emphasizing authoring workflows and collaborative experiences instead of theme-level customization.</p>
<p>Some major updates to the site editor experience and workflow include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new sidebar experience that makes editing site navigation more efficient.</li>
<li>Block Settings are now split into settings and styles to make the UI easier to understand.</li>
<li>Add new blocks easier with drag and drop capabilities for media and a split view option so you can swiftly navigate categories and previews.</li>
<li>Search for free-use images on Openverse directly in the editor.</li>
<li>Write completely distraction-free by hiding panels and controls.</li>
<li>Copy and paste complete styles from one block to another.</li>
<li>Easily push style updates of a block to apply globally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/10up/classifai/releases/tag/1.8.0">latest 1.8 release of ClassifAI</a> incorporates an innovative Recommended Content Block feature — giving sites the ability to <strong>recommend related content to users through the use of artificial intelligence</strong> (AI).</p>
<p>Built by 10up’s Open Source Practice, <a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a> is a free WordPress plugin that augments sites, streamlines the editorial process, and increases audience engagement by utilizing AI and machine learning (ML). Since its launch, the plugin’s capabilities have grown to include automated content tagging and classification, AI-powered image tagging and descriptive alt text assignment, smart focal point cropping, and image / PDF optical character recognition (OCR).</p>
<p>The newly added Recommended Content Block recommends additional content to site visitors based on their behavior. For instance, after finishing an article or video, the Recommended Content Block will offer suggestions on what to read or watch next based on sitewide traffic history, encouraging the reader to extend their session by interacting with more content.</p>

<p>This February, 10up celebrates our twelfth anniversary — a year of team and revenue growth, innovation in our solutions, and continued contributions to the open web and greater community. Our work continued to be recognized around the web, earning 10up nods as <strong>WordPress VIP’s Inaugural Gold Partner of the Quarter and 2022 Partner of the Year,</strong> garnering another <strong>Webby Award</strong> for our work on <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/">Democracy Docket</a>, and an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carole-munroe_stories-from-hilton-activity-7013635495473618944-nVet?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Innovation SABRE Award</a> for our work on <a href="https://stories.hilton.com/">Stories From Hilton</a>, among other recognitions. Our clients agreed: we’re honored to <strong>exceed a 70+ net promoter score (NPS)</strong> from our clients in both halves of 2022, the threshold of a “world-class” service partner.</p>

<p>Having spent another year making the web better alongside our clients and partners, we’ll be disconnecting our screens and recharging our batteries so that we can bring our best, again, in 2023.</p>
<p>As we bring 2022 to a close, <strong>10up will shut down for the holidays on Friday, December 23, and reopen on Tuesday, January 3.</strong></p>
<p>With gratitude to the clients, friends, partners, and colleagues who made another successful year possible, we wish you a festive and relaxing season.</p>

<p>Released last week, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/misha/">WordPress 6.1</a> (“Misha”) primarily delivers enhancements to the full site building experience in the Block Editor. The 6.1 release introduces a new default theme, Twenty Twenty-Three, and a suite of performance and usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of new content templates that can accelerate page creation.</li>
<li>Block Template parts can now be defined in classic themes.</li>
<li>Performance improvements including caching `WP_Query` database queries, priming caches in `REST API` and multisite network options queries, as well as new Site Health checks for Persistent Object Cache and Page Cache.</li>
<li>Site Editor settings now sync across browsers and devices for each editor.</li>
<li>Improved ability to select partial paragraphs within a block.</li>
<li>The option to keep the list view of all blocks in a post on the left side as the default, as opposed to previously having to toggle it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In keeping with our mission to make a better web, 10up strives to strengthen and <a href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">contribute back to</a> the open-source technology ecosystem we build upon. We contribute thousands of hours each year and open source innovations like <a href="https://www.elasticpress.io/">ElasticPress</a>, which integrates Elastic and WordPress; <a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a>, which brings AI and machine learning to WordPress; and <a href="https://distributorplugin.com/">Distributor</a>, which solves for cross-site content reuse. We also share our <a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/">Engineering Best Practices</a> and <a href="https://10up.github.io/Open-Source-Best-Practices/">Open Source Best Practices</a> as public projects on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>In that same spirit, we have now publicly opened up – and open <em>sourced</em> – our WordPress <a href="https://gutenberg.10up.com/">Gutenberg Best Practices</a> documentation.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gutenberg.10up.com/">Gutenberg Best Practices</a> project began as an internal onboarding and continuing education resource detailing the “10up Way” when it comes to the WordPress block editor and client editorial experience. In deciding to open up in beta as a public resource, our goal is to help developers learn about the WordPress block editor and extend it through the customization of core blocks and the carefully crafted development of custom blocks.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Google announced the official <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/">end-of-life for Google Analytics 3: Universal Analytics</a> and rallied partners and customers to prepare to migrate to its successor, <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new-way-unify-app-and-website-measurement-google-analytics/">Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</a>.</p>
<p>To quote Google directly, “Universal Analytics was built for a generation of online measurement that was anchored in the desktop web, independent sessions, and more easily observable data from cookies.” Today, organizations engage online with audiences who consume content with multiple devices and across multiple channels, including apps and, sometimes, multiple websites.</p>
<p>Growing consumer privacy concerns and evolving data privacy regulations also require organizations to rethink how they track customer journeys. While Universal Analytics offers limited privacy settings, GA4 is designed with user privacy at its core, with an anonymized model for tracking user behavior (no longer storing IP addresses) and detailed country-level privacy controls. </p>

It’s the perfect solution for small to medium-size publishers who want to put their best digital foot forward to impress advertising partners and sponsors, without the cost and complexity of a fully bespoke solution.</p>
<p>Publisher Media Kit introduces new editor <a href="https://wordpress.org/patterns/">block patterns</a> to the WordPress editor inspired by common media kit content, like Cover, Audience Profiles, Stats, Packages, Why Buy Ads, and Questions/Contact.

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/josephine/">WordPress 5.9, released last week</a>, marks the first public release of WordPress’ long-anticipated full site editing functionality alongside other block editor enhancements.</p>
<p>Full site editing extends the block editor’s reach beyond the boundaries of a single page: empowering the customization and management of global elements like a site’s header, footer, and menus just like any other block. To enable and use the feature, a site’s existing theme must be adapted or a new theme that’s made for the feature, called a “block theme,” must be created. We’re excited by the opportunities full site editing introduces.</p>

<p>10up’s <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/open-source-practice/">Open Source Practice</a> has doubled down on contributing tools, time, and code to the WordPress community to empower developers and ensure longevity for the open-source platform that supports many of our largest clients — a platform that now powers more than 40% of all websites. In the last year, that meant investing 6,500+ hours across 30+ projects, which included updates to our flagship plugins like <a href="https://distributorplugin.com/">Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.elasticpress.io/">ElasticPress</a>, and <a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a>, among other plugins, and several new WordPress plugin releases like <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/block-for-apple-maps-wordpress-plugin/">Block For Apple Maps</a>, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2021/eight-day-week/">Eight Day Week</a>, and <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2021/convert-to-blocks/">Convert to Blocks</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce the release of a new WordPress plugin, <strong>Insecure Content Warning</strong>, and share updates to several smaller popular plugins.</p>

<p>At 10up, we make a better web by finely crafting websites and tools for content creators. We also give back to our community of digital makers by encouraging team members to share their experience, insights, and lessons learned at industry events, and through engagement with online media. Here are some recent and upcoming highlights around the web:</p>
<h2>Torque Social Hour</h2>
<p>Our President &amp; Founder Jake Goldman kicked things off as a special guest on <a href="https://youtu.be/6Tnr_mJTAtU">The Torque Social Hour</a>, a weekly livestream about WordPress news, events, and life. The show spends a lot of time on headless WordPress solutions like WP Engine’s Atlas product and Jake discusses some newer 10up plugins and our ongoing contributions to the open source community. </p>

<p>When I founded 10up, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/adjusting-to-remote-work/">building a remote company at scale</a> was somewhat of a novelty. Our agency has been featured in case studies, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Work-Together-Anywhere-Remotely-Successfully-Individuals-ebook/dp/B07C2TTZVG">books</a>, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/remote-work-culture/">ebooks</a>, <a href="https://www.boye-co.com/blog/2019/7/1/how-to-make-remote-working-successful">interviews</a>, and <a href="https://www.comparably.com/articles/10-companies-with-fully-remote-workforces-that-are-hiring-now/">articles</a> about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/25/10-virtual-companies-offering-six-figure-salaries.html">remote work culture</a>, including a Forbes list of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/03/31/at-these-125-companies-all-or-most-employees-work-remotely/#6e81772b6530">notable remote work companies</a>. I have guest lectured at universities like Stanford and the University of Michigan on the subject. Where we were once early pioneers of a new model, companies around the globe have come to embrace remote work.</p>
<p>Now, more than <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2021/10-years/">10 years in</a>, we’re called to revisit how we think about remote work in the context of client service, continued pioneering of working models, and cultivating a happy, healthy, high-performing workplace.</p>
<p>For instance, one thing we’ve realized is that when you already work remotely or stay at home during time off, a day off doesn’t always feel like a day off. When your home and office are the same place, and “entering the office” is only few taps away on that computer in your pocket, finding a healthy work/life balance can be a challenge.</p>
<p>While evaluating potential improvements to the 10up workforce experience, we found ourselves asking, <em>“Client service is our number one value — can we make meaningful changes for our team without diminishing our customer experience?”</em></p>

<p>Ten years ago today, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/my-first-patch-helen/">I submitted my very first proposed change to WordPress itself</a> and not long after, in August of 2011, I joined 10up. I have been fortunate to be a part of and grow with the WordPress community in the decade since. Not only have I grown from Web Engineer to Director of Open Source Initiatives at 10up, but also in that time, I’ve gone from being a first-time contributor to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/#the-wordpress-core-team">one of a handful of WordPress lead&nbsp;developers</a>.</p>
<p>The power of open source and its communities continues to astound and humble me. I could never have dreamed this is where a little curiosity about <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/#bill-of-rights">the second freedom</a> to “study how the program works and change it to make it do what you wish” would lead… and I look forward to seeing what the next decade of my career brings with&nbsp;it.</p>

</p>
<p>A significant Google search algorithm update coming this June incorporates new performance metrics: <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience">Core Web Vitals</a>. A new set of ranking signals based around page experience combines Core Web Vitals with existing signals such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search">mobile-friendliness</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2016/09/more-safe-browsing-help-for-webmasters">safe-browsing</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2016/11/heres-to-more-https-on-web">HTTPS-security</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2016/08/helping-users-easily-access-content-on">intrusive interstitial guidelines</a> to provide a holistic picture of the quality of a user’s experience on a web page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26815" src="https://10up.com/uploads/2021/04/google-core-web-vitals.png" alt="Google Core Web Vitals" width="1208" height="846" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2021/04/google-core-web-vitals.png 1208w, https://10up.com/uploads/2021/04/google-core-web-vitals-300x210.png 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2021/04/google-core-web-vitals-800x560.png 800w, https://10up.com/uploads/2021/04/google-core-web-vitals-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1208px) 100vw, 1208px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>Google tends to be guarded when it comes to big algorithm updates and how those changes impact search engine results and page rankings. This time, the search giant has provided explicit insight into what’s coming and how site owners and digital agencies can prepare.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> were introduced by Google less than a year ago to measure real-world web page user experiences and provide guidance for delivering a great experience. While Google captures many data points that speak to site performance and considers <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors">hundreds of ranking factors</a> in its algorithm, the Core Web Vitals this update will focus on are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 14px;"><a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a>: Measures perceived load speed — the time from clicking a link to seeing the majority of the on-screen content.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 14px;"><a href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay (FID)</a>: Measures responsiveness and interactivity — the time “long” tasks delay a visitor’s ability to interact with a page.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a>: Measures visual stability — the unexpected movement of page elements due to lengthy load time or ad insertions that hinder user interaction and experience.</li>

Open Source Friday is a place for maintainers to share demos, stories, and inspiration with other GitHub users.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about using GitHub Actions to solve common problems in the WordPress development ecosystem, such as with 10up’s <a href="https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy">WordPress Plugin Deploy Action</a>, and how the WordPress project itself uses GitHub Actions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/convert-to-blocks/">Convert to Blocks</a> is a new WordPress plugin that automatically converts existing classic content to blocks when a page or post needs to be edited.</strong></p>
<p>The plugin works upon activation, with no configuration needed and does nothing until an editor needs to update or edit an existing piece of content. If a page or post is not already formatted using blocks when the editor is opened, Convert to Blocks automatically maps the content to the relevant blocks that come with WordPress. This approach ensures that existing and older content is preserved as-is until modified, which reduces the risk of unknowingly breaking a page or post content.</p>

<p><strong>We recently relaunched Eight Day Week, our free, open-source plugin that adds web-to-print workflow capabilities to WordPress.</strong> As part of the relaunch, we rolled out a <a href="https://eightdayweekplugin.com/">new microsite</a> to help explain the plugin. </p>
<p>With no settings or configurations to set up, the plugin empowers publishers to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:14px;">Design individual print publications by organizing WordPress Posts into Print Issues. Within print issues, editors can create sections, arrange articles, and manage each article’s status.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:14px;">Manage access for print production staff with new print users roles isolated to access and CMS capabilities relevant to their job — e.g. creating and managing issues, viewing issue information, and exporting for final production.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:24px;">Export the print issue as an XML package that can be imported into Adobe InDesign for final page layout and print production.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This February, 10up celebrates its 10th anniversary.</strong> That’s ten years since I sat down alone in a small home office in Rhode Island, and decided I was ready to start this business.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 30% of businesses reach the 10-year mark. It’s a milestone that has us looking back at our journey from a company of one to a team of more than 230 talented specialists, and looking ahead to the next 10 years.</p>
<p>To kick start some of this reflection, we asked the team if anyone wanted to share what 10up means to them today. Here are just a few clips from those who volunteered to record their thoughts.</p>

<p>This release follows several smaller updates that introduced a sticky post filter that displays specified posts atop search results, improved support for searching terms (like tags), a related posts block for the WordPress block editor, and a widget for filtering WooCommerce results by price.</p>

<p><a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a> — our free, open-source plugin that augments WordPress-powered websites with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology — is taking another step forward in support of content creators and digital publishers. Our newest release, ClassifAI 1.6, integrates <strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scanning of screenshots and other imagery</strong>.</p>
<p>ClassifAI 1.6 launches on the heels of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/22/facebook-and-instagram-embeds-to-be-deprecated-october-24th/">Facebook and Instagram dropping support for open embeds</a>, which prevents platforms like WordPress from easily displaying original social posts by dropping a link into the editor. The OCR technology in ClassifAI 1.6 arrives at an opportune moment, making it easier to display social media posts on a WordPress site without compromising accessibility.</p>

<p>Working with large stakeholder groups can present challenges when working to reach a unified consensus on the design vision for a project. To encourage collaboration and ensure everyone feels confident and comfortable sharing ideas and opinions without judgment, 10up uses an exercise called Design Shopping.</p>
<p>In my recent article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/design-shopping-workflow-showcase/">Design Shopping: Get A Faster Client Buy-In Through A Guided Design Showcase</a>, published by <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, I explain our Design Shopping workflow and how it was used to gain client buy-in and facilitate swift design decisions when redesigning the <a href="http://dmv.ca.gov/">California DMV website</a>.</p>
<p>Design Shopping helps stakeholder groups quickly align around a shared design vocabulary and foundational design principles in a deliberate, meaningful way by removing the pressure of being right or wrong. When done right, this exercise turns big picture possibilities into a tangible design direction.</p>
<p>If you’d like your next design and UX project driven by a creative team that prioritizes collaboration, clear communication, and caring client services, <a href="https://10up.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>We hear about audiences from stakeholders. We learn about audiences from analytics, demographics, and surveys. But hearing their feelings, hopes for your product, and motivations is an invaluable tool in shaping content, calls to action, and platform strategies. By exploring audiences in-depth, you can better, and more accurately, define segments.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2020, in partnership with GatherContent, I am presenting the webinar, <a href="https://gathercontent.com/events/avoid-assumptions-using-research-to-define-audiences-in-their-own-words">Avoid assumptions: Using research to define audiences in their own words</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past year, in partnership with <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">Google News Initiative</a> (GNI), 10up has been working with hyperlocal publishers like <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/assets/static/docs/2019_GN_CaseStudy_LongBeachPost_final.pdf">Long Beach Post</a>, <a href="https://vtdigger.org/">VT Digger</a>, <a href="https://oilcity.news/">Oil City News</a>, and <a href="https://www.bkreader.com/">BK Reader</a> to drive digital strategies for audience and revenue growth.</p>
<p>One strategy — refreshing ad slots after a set amount of time — successfully leveraged existing web traffic to increase ad impressions. This revenue-boosting strategy typically requires an ad-savvy web engineer for implementation.</p>
<h2>Ad Refresh Control for WordPress</h2>
<p>In keeping with the vision of <a href="https://adrevenuelab.10up.com/">our GNI partnership</a> — providing widely applicable solutions that are relatively easy to implement — <strong>10up created Ad Refresh Control, a free, open source, WordPress plugin that empowers publishers to easily control the refreshing of ads</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-refresh-control/">Ad Refresh Control</a> works immediately upon activation, enabling active view refresh for Google Ad Manager ad units without needing to modify any code. Active view refresh helps publishers recoup lost impressions by reloading a visible ad unit after a set amount of time.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the feature length <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/makeshift-documentary/">make|SHIFT</a> documentary explored the history of modern advertising and the role open-source technology played in its evolution. The film highlights the brands, makers, and agencies — including 10up — who harness new technology, test new business models, and question the status quo in an age that gives consumers the power to determine how, when, and where they connect with brands.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/Q0bN8CAmsUQ">new make|SHIFT short film</a>, clocking in at just under four minutes, highlights the critical role open source plays in creating the complex experiences consumers demand and features insights from myself, 10up’s President and founder Jake Goldman, and our CEO John Eckman.</p>

<p>Aiming to increase the number of women involved in leading and regularly contributing to WordPress releases, earlier this year WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden shared an official stretch goal of an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/11/all-women-release-squad/">all-women release squad</a>. A May update on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/05/29/2020-wordpress-release-squads/">2020 release squads</a> confirmed the realization of that goal for the WordPress 5.6 release. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/wordpress-5-5-release/">WordPress 5.5 released</a>, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/13/wordpress-5-6-release-planning/">WordPress 5.6 planning announcement</a> officially <strong>introduced the women leading the release, including 10up’s own Director of Open Source Initiatives Helen Hou-Sandì who will serve as Core Tech Lead</strong>.</p>

<p>This Thursday I’m participating in the <a href="https://echai.network/CoRise">CoRise Summit</a> — a free global startup summit to CoLearn, Collaborate, and CoRise with the community. As a panelist in a session on Building Remote Teams and Company Culture (August 27 at 12:30 PM ET), I’m looking forward to sharing some of our insights on <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/adjusting-to-remote-work/">building and managing a distributed team</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also happy to be a contributor to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Teams-Work-Handbook-Successful-ebook/dp/B08FMRG8P7/">Remote Teams Work</a>. It’s a new book out this month that provides strategic and practical guidance on establishing and running a successful remote team, including tools and methodologies, hiring and salaries, and creating a remote culture.</p>
<p>As more and more companies adjust to remote work and the value of distributed teams, hopefully they can benefit from the best practices we’ve seen and experienced. </p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/wordpress-5-5-eckstine/">WordPress 5.5 was released</a> last week, featuring automatic updates for plugins and themes, lazy-loading images, extensible XML sitemaps, improvements to the block editor, and as always, supplemental under the hood security, performance, and developer improvements. As always, many 10uppers contributed to this release.</p>
<p>This latest release introduces a number of improvements to the block content editor. Highlights include inline image editing that lets you crop, rotate, and zoom photos within image blocks; device previews that show how content will appear to visitors with different screen sizes; and a Block Directory that lets you find, install, and insert third-party blocks in the editor, without ever leaving the page.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, August 13, 2020, 10up kicks off a <a href="https://publishersonair.withgoogle.com/events/gni-revenue-lab">free, four-part workshop series</a> covering lessons and tactics used in the GNI Ad Revenue Lab to accelerate participating publishers’ advertising revenue.</p>
<p>The GNI Ad Revenue Lab, which kicked off in September 2019, is a <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">Google News Initiative</a> project conducted in partnership with <a href="https://www.lionpublishers.com/">LION Publishers</a> and <a href="https://10up.com/">10up</a> to establish a web-based revenue optimization blueprint local news publishers can use as a reference point for website improvements.</p>
<p>As part of the Ad Revenue Lab, we have been working with seven hyperlocal U.S. publishers, like <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/assets/static/docs/2019_GN_CaseStudy_LongBeachPost_final.pdf">Long Beach Post</a>, to provide and measure reader revenue-focused digital strategies, often testing new tactics. From ad viewability and fill rate optimization to article markup and sitemaps to Google AMP and the optimization of ads, images, and page speed, we’ve documented our findings and are now sharing them more widely.</p>

<p>Effectively articulating a brand’s design aesthetic can be challenging for even the most savvy marketers. How do we take statements like “make it pop” and turn them into a more specific, shared design vision without frustrating revisions?</p>
<p>In my recent article, <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/leadership-insights/make-it-pop-design-spectrum-exercise/">A Design Spectrum Exercise for Navigating ‘Make it Pop’ Client Requests</a>, published on the Adobe XD Ideas blog, I share a tool — the Design Spectrum exercise — we use at 10up with government, higher-ed, and Fortune 500 teams to gain creative alignment, build trust, reduce revision requests, and earn faster design approvals.</p>
<p>A Design Spectrum exercise shapes intangible concepts in an approachable way that cuts through ambiguity and identifies client design preferences and taste. This creates a framework of shared understanding that establishes the foundation for a smooth design process.</p>

<p>With a growing portfolio of clients and partnerships in higher education, we are once again thrilled to <a href="https://2020.wpcampus.org/sponsor/10up/">sponsor</a> and participate in <a href="https://2019.wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>, furthering the confluence of WordPress in academia. This year’s two-day remote conference kicks-off today, July 29, 2020; registration is free.</p>
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>On the schedule, you’ll find two 10uppers delivering presentations:</p>
<p><strong>End to End Accessibility Testing</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, testing interaction has been a largely manual process because out-of-the-box automation testing tools can’t open menus, check ARIA states, click around, or test general UI and movement. Because of this, as sites age, they can quickly fall out of compliance and become slowly inaccessible. </p>
<p>In this session, Tim Wright, Director of Front End Engineering will discuss <a href="https://2020.wpcampus.org/schedule/end-to-end-accessibility-testing/">end to end accessibility testing</a>. Learn how to create a long term accessibility roadmap and turn manual testing processes into lightweight automated scripts that can keep an eye on your project for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>AI 101: How Artificial Intelligence Can Help Educators Publish More, Faster, And Better</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence isn’t just for self-driving cars and science fiction. Learn how easy-to-integrate solutions can help educators publish more effective content, promote accessibility, and keep visitors engaged. In this special sponsor presentation, Phil Crumm, Vice President, New Client Strategy, will help educators, technical leaders, content creators, and marketers understand how <a href="https://2020.wpcampus.org/schedule/ai-101-artificial-intelligence/">machine learning and artificial intelligence</a> can simplify content creation, accelerate authorship, and eliminate painful manual tasks. </p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/maps-block-apple/">Block for Apple Maps</a> is our latest free WordPress plugin that enables site owners to easily create, configure, and display embedded Apple Maps on web pages and posts. The plugin adds a new Apple Maps block to the WordPress block editor, also known as Gutenberg. </p>
<p>We’ve been tinkering with embedded Apple Maps since Apple announced the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/212/">MapKit JS API</a> in 2018. Following some major improvements to their Maps service, and with some clients interested in evaluating alternatives to other popular solutions (for reasons ranging from API pricing to privacy policies), we thought we’d use Apple’s annual WWDC conference this week as an excuse to finish up our work and bring our Block for Apple Maps plugin to life.</p>
<p><strong>With Block for Apple Maps, site owners can embed a responsive Apple Maps component on any page or post that uses the WordPress block editor.</strong></p>
<p>The block offers several customization options, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the map’s center point by looking up a location</li>
<li>Adding markers to annotate specific point of interests</li>
<li>Selecting the satellite, hybrid, standard, or muted standard map type</li>
<li>Showing or hiding controls, including the compass, zoom, and rotation</li>
<li>Setting the map height</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, Director of Client Delivery for 10up Europe, Lily Bonney, and I co-hosted a webinar on <a href="https://www.onezeero.com/en/onezeero-blog/how-to-build-and-retain-team-culture-remotely">recruiting, onboarding, and maintaining company culture at a distance</a> with Onezeero, a UK-based tech recruitment partner. As organizations increasingly recognize the benefits of working from home, many are asking, “How do we still maintain our ‘essence’ at a distance?” From transparency during hiring to clear systems, processes, and company values, we’ve learned how to attract, onboard, and grow remote talent. Lily and I shared how 10up fosters meaningful connections and cultivates a vibrant team culture.</p>

<p>Last week saw yet another incident in a long and tragic history of police and other violence against Black Americans in the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. This comes on the heels of a series of similarly senseless and devastating deaths across the country — Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, among a painfully longer list of names. In the aftermath, we’ve seen an outpouring of support and outrage, through worldwide, large-scale protests.</p>
<p><strong>We are heartbroken</strong>, witnessing both the continued legacy of racial and structural inequality and the ensuing violence and property destruction that further hurts communities already reeling from the pandemic.</p>
<p>As a company, we want to be clear that <strong>we are opposed to police brutality and violence</strong>. Further, <strong>we are opposed to discrimination in all its forms</strong>. This specifically includes discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin, but also gender identity &amp; expression, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, and age.</p>

<p>make|SHIFT explores the history of modern advertising and the role that creative technology played in its evolution. </p>
<p>The full-length documentary, produced by WP Engine, highlights the makers, agencies, and brands who had the courage to harness new technology, test new business models, and question the status quo. It professes to “feature more than 40 of the top marketing and tech minds in the industry, from developers and designers to creative directors to founders at some of the most innovative agencies in the world” — including 10up. </p>
<p>Our president and founder Jake Goldman and CEO John Eckman are both featured in the film, which will be released on Thursday, May 28 during Ad Age’s <a href="https://adagepublisherspanel-0528.splashthat.com/">Publisher’s Panel</a> and streamed live at <a href="https://makeshift.film/">makeshift.film</a>.</p>

<p>WordSesh is a live, highly-curated, free virtual conference centered around WordPress. <a href="https://wordsesh.com/">WordSesh Americas 2020</a>, happening this Wednesday, May 27, includes 12 sessions that touch on topics like headless WordPress, client services, and communication skills.</p>
<p>I am excited to be a part of the lineup, sharing <strong>how developers can make the most of a development tool they are probably already using: Github</strong>.</p>
<p>Github is used by many developers to build and manage both public plugins and themes and private work. My session takes a closer look at <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/wordpress-github-actions-streamline-plugin-deployment/">GitHub Actions</a>, a newer feature to help with automation for repetitive tasks like testing and deployment. It will cover WordPress-specific Actions, tying multiple Actions together in a workflow, and ideas for how to continually improve development processes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was a guest on <a href="https://gutenbergtimes.com/">Gutenberg Times</a> Live, discussing the inner workings of the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/scaffold/block/">Create Block scaffolding tool</a> and the creation of new templates. The “WordPress/create-block” tool is a Command Line Application that facilitates the building and registering of new block plugins to help developers extend the capabilities of the WordPress block editor.</p>
<p>The discussion revolved around my pull request, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22175">Create block: Add support for external templates hosted on npm</a>. I demonstrated how this proposed solution makes it easier to create new block templates.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://youtu.be/NbrME0UlYbQ">watch the video</a> on the Gutenberg Times YouTube Channel.</p>

<p>In March 2019, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) finalized <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/blog/final-version-of-app-ads-txt-ready-for-adoption-to-fight-inventory-fraud-in-mobile-apps-and-ott/">app-ads.txt</a>, an extension of the original <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/ads-txt-manager-for-wordpress/">ads.txt standard</a> that provides publishers a mechanism to declare their authorized digital sellers. By August, Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/app-ads-txt-protects-app-revenue-and-brand/">began blocking</a> the serving of unauthorized ad inventory based on app-ads.txt files.</p>
<p><strong>Today we’re happy to share that our WordPress plugin, Ads.txt Manager, now supports both ads.txt and app-ads.txt file types.</strong></p>

<p>Extensive <a href="https://10up.com/our-work/">experience</a> working with some of the world’s largest content creators has given 10up unique insight into the needs of digital publishers: increasing audience engagement, improving workflow efficiency, enhancing search engine performance, and growing revenue. As market challenges in digital publishing mount, parallel <strong>growth in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies offer important opportunities</strong> for content creators that will only grow in importance in the future.</p>
<p>While still relatively new and not yet widely adopted within the publishing industry, AI and ML can already provide forward-thinking content creators a chance to get ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Our new whitepaper, <strong>Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Digital Content Creators</strong> examines how AI and ML are spurring innovation in content management, personalization, and website experiences. It also highlights real world solutions — including <a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a>, our plugin that augments WordPress-powered websites with AI/ML technology — that help digital content creators save time and streamline workflows.</p>

<p>In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations across the globe have been forced to adapt and overcome unprecedented circumstances. One such organization is our long-term client StoryCorps who recently launched <a href="https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-connect/">StoryCorps Connect</a>, a new browser-based video conferencing platform engineered by 10up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect.png" alt="StoryCorps Connect" width="1600" height="1022" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23515" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect.png 1600w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-300x192.png 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-800x511.png 800w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-768x491.png 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-1536x981.png 1536w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-194x124.png 194w, https://10up.com/uploads/2020/04/storycorps-connect-141x90.png 141w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>With a mission to preserve and share humanity’s stories, StoryCorps has collected living histories of more than 300,000 Americans. Stored at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, the StoryCorps archive is the largest conglomerate of human voice in the world. </p>
<p>To date, the stories have been gathered through live, in-person interviews facilitated by StoryCorps moderators and recorded with their mobile app. However, under orders to <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/adjusting-to-remote-work/">stay at home</a> and practice social distancing, the interviews came to a screeching halt. </p>

<p>User experience research involves evaluating and capturing user behavior and interactions, and requires interactive collaboration and prototyping with participants and stakeholders. With remote work on the rise, leading UX researchers have adopted a new generation of tools that facilitate this research and collaboration without the need for in person interaction.</p>
<p>In the article <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/best-ux-research-tools/">5 Effective UX Research Tools That the Experts Use</a>, Adobe asked professional UX researchers and designers — including 10up’s own lead UX designers Ben Grace and Melissa Vander Wilt — to spotlight their user UX research tools of choice. </p>
<p>Ben shares how 10up leverages digital whiteboard and remote team collaboration software <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a> to plan and prep for research, keep the team organized, and socialize findings.</p>
<p>Melissa highlights 10up’s use of <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a> to perform user testing and behavior analysis, run surveys and polls, and gather insights for ongoing optimization. </p>

<p>Consumers have become accustomed to optimized mobile experiences. Billions use popular apps — WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Gmail, and Twitter — to perform small acts of publishing, like sharing content, editing photos, uploading videos, and inserting URLs. These applications deliver carefully constructed user experiences focused on a narrow set of specific content creation tasks. </p>
<p><em>But what does the mobile experience look like for those managing website content?</em></p>
<p>10up conducted a user experience study to understand how consumers are creating, publishing, and managing website content from mobile devices. The study included live user interviews and a survey of 148 qualified participants from 30 countries about their individual experiences using website admin dashboards on smartphones.</p>

<p><a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a> — our plugin that augments WordPress-powered websites with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology — was <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/classifai-ai-machine-learning-wordpress/">released last year</a>. As a connector to cloud-based services like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/">Microsoft Azure AI</a>, ClassifAI introduced the automatic tagging and classification of content as well as the assignment of descriptive alt text to images to WordPress.</p>
<p>Since that time, 10up has shipped the <a href="https://github.com/10up/classifai/releases/tag/1.4.0">1.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/10up/classifai/releases/tag/1.5.0">1.5</a> releases, representing a substantial ongoing investment in ClassifAI and our commitment to driving applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology forward in the content management and open source industries. <strong>Highlights of ClassifAI’s recent releases include automated image tagging, smart focal point cropping of images, bulk scanning of existing content, and other vital enhancements</strong>.</p>

<p>When I joined 10up two and a half years ago to lead our strategic and commercial growth across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), I was not only starting a new position, I was beginning an entirely new remote work experience. Inspired by companies like <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, and fueled by the explosion in video conferencing and digital collaboration tools, 10up was founded as a fully distributed digital agency: our entire team, now <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2020/10ups-9th-anniversary/">200 full-time team members</a>, works from home or in some cases, co working spaces, around the globe.</p>
<p>10up has been featured in case studies, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Work-Together-Anywhere-Remotely-Successfully-Individuals-ebook/dp/B07C2TTZVG">books</a>, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/remote-work-culture/">ebooks</a>, <a href="https://www.boye-co.com/blog/2019/7/1/how-to-make-remote-working-successful">interviews</a>, and <a href="https://www.comparably.com/articles/10-companies-with-fully-remote-workforces-that-are-hiring-now/">articles</a> about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/25/10-virtual-companies-offering-six-figure-salaries.html">remote work culture</a>, including a Forbes list of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/03/31/at-these-125-companies-all-or-most-employees-work-remotely/#6e81772b6530">notable remote work companies</a>. Our founder and president, Jake Goldman, has guest lectured at universities like Stanford and University of Michigan on the subject.</p>
<p>As a social person who enjoys collaborating with others, I didn’t know what to expect from a work-at-home culture and I wondered how I would be able to collaborate effectively with colleagues located around the world. Thankfully, my nerves were laid to rest quickly as I learned that a remote work culture can operate and even feel very similar to an in-office culture.</p>
<p>Faced with global health concerns and efforts to contain a rapidly spreading virus, many traditional in-office workforces are asking employees to work from home. For many professionals, this will be their first time navigating a remote work lifestyle. With that mind, I thought it might help to share some of the ways we approach remote work, foster meaningful connections, and cultivate a vibrant team culture.</p>

<p>In 1994, the first website banner ad appeared on HotWired.com, boasting a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-first-ever-banner-ad-on-the-web/523728/">44% clickthrough rate</a>. Since then, publishers have been investing in monetization strategies like direct display advertising and sponsored content to boost revenues. Today, distracted consumers, increased competition, banner blindness, and ad blocking tools make website monetization an increasing challenge for publishers.</p>

<p>This February, 10up wrapped its ninth year with much to celebrate. The company saw continued team and financial growth, with our most significant expansions across our European division, productized Managed Services offerings, and strategic Audience &amp; Revenue consulting services. We also doubled down on our contributions to a broader open web community, and team culture.</p>
<p>The result: We continued to expand our client roster with some of our most impressive wins to date. In 2019, we welcomed some of the most respected brands and organizations in the world into our portfolio, and expanded existing relationships with industry leading clients like Google and Microsoft.</p>
<h2>Consistent Revenue And Team Growth</h2>
<p><a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/10ups-8th-anniversary/">10up’s eighth anniversary</a> celebrated significant financial and team growth, which continued into our ninth year. We achieved <strong>18% revenue growth</strong> and gained <strong>48 new clients</strong> across verticals including healthcare, publishing, government, high tech, architecture, and financial services. We’re especially pleased by the increased diversification of that revenue across pillar accounts, which we see as vital to a healthy, sustainable workplace in the services sector. While in 2018, 20% of our revenue came from a single client, <strong>2019 included five seven-figure clients</strong>, with the largest accounting for only 9% of company-wide revenue.</p>
<p>The growth of our client portfolio along with our commitment to exceptional client delivery drove the expansion of Team10up to <strong>200 full-timers</strong>. This includes <strong>two full-time, in-house recruiters</strong> and <strong>10uppers spread across six continents and twenty-four countries</strong> (tell Antarctica we’re hiring). The executive team also expanded, as we welcomed our first full time Chief Financial Officer, Chuck Barlett, and made three internal promotions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah Williams, VP, Client Delivery</li>
<li>Phil Crum, VP, New Client Strategy</li>
<li>Martha Schmidt, VP, Account Strategy</li>

<p>The GNI Revenue Accelerator Program is a partnership between the <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">Google News Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.lionpublishers.com/">LION Publishers</a>, and <a href="https://10up.com/">10up</a> focused on establishing a foundational blueprint for local publishers to comprehensively optimize their web-based revenue. The pilot program kicked off in September 2019 and will continue throughout 2020. </p>
<p>The conditions for quality local journalism can be daunting. Digital ad revenue isn’t growing fast enough to offset decreases in print ad revenue, even as news organizations need to invest more to keep pace with digital innovation and change. As larger publishers leverage their resources to quickly adopt and integrate new technologies, they attract more readers and widen the gap between large-scale publishers and smaller publishers who lack the same resources.</p>
<p><strong>The GNI Revenue Accelerator Program aims to help local publishers keep pace, by providing technology resources to drive insights, traffic, engagement, and revenue yield.</strong> The core solutions and tactics the program offers are focused on universally applicable challenges and relatively easy-to-implement solutions. The goal isn’t to just help the publishers in the program, but to provide all publishers with a data-backed reference point for growing their audience and increasing their revenue.</p>

<p>10up often finds itself immersed in the business of publishing, which includes the configuration and management of the programmatic buying and selling of ad space.

With more than <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ads-txt/">70,000 active installations</a>, the plugin has helped thousands of site owners eliminate the need to manually upload a new ads.txt file with every change and applies validation to prevent simple mistakes that can cause lost advertising revenue. Learn more about the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Ads.txt initiative and its benefits in our <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/ads-txt-manager-for-wordpress/">launch post</a>.</p>

<p>Brightly colored screens in low-light environments can <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side">keep people up at night</a>, contribute to eyestrain, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/dark-mode-ios-13-test/">burn up battery life on newer devices with OLED displays</a>. In recent years, all major operating systems — <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976">macOS</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210332">iOS</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/01/windows-10-tip-dark-theme-in-file-explorer/">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme">Android</a> — have added a dark-mode option. With this setting, the OS and any application that supports dark mode can switch from a light color scheme to darker tone, which offers UI personalization and reduces eye fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>With all major web browsers now supporting the dark-mode setting, web developers can also serve either a light or dark theme, based on the user’s device setting.</strong></p>
<p>Apple news site 9to5mac, a long-term client, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/09/dark-mode-iphone-ipad-mac/">added dark-mode support</a> to its site just before the official release of iOS 13 last Fall — the first version of the iPhone operating system to offer dark mode.</p>

<p>At 10up, we think digital innovation often happens at the intersection of expertise in design and engineering. The latest release of ElasticPress represents 10up innovation at its best, bringing together expertise in user interface design, web engineering, and systems architecture. In ElasticPress 3.1, we’ve introduced a simple and friendly user interface right inside of WordPress for managing search result weighting and customized results; a challenge that required Elasticsearch appliance expertise, and advanced WordPress UI and back end development.</p>
<p>From information discovery and filtering to data visualization and mapping, search is the foundation of many digital experiences across the websites and apps we use every day.</p>
<p>Thousands of websites rely on <a href="https://www.elasticpress.io/">ElasticPress</a> to extend the native WordPress search functionality through an integration with Elasticsearch, a fast, scalable way to manage searchable content in near-real-time. The release of <a href="https://www.elasticpress.io/blog/2019/11/weighting-and-search-ordering/">ElasticPress 3.1</a>, that includes weighted search and custom search ordering, moves several popular code-based features into an intuitive dashboard that provides a comfortable experience for anyone familiar with WordPress.</p>

<p>According to GitHub, developers have contributed more than <a href="https://github.blog/2019-10-08-github-actions-from-open-source-maintainers/">1,200 Actions to GitHub Marketplace</a> since <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> was released in beta last year. Our mission to craft tools for content creators — including developers — and our passion for <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/open-source-practice/">open-source contribution</a> led us to make <strong>a solution that uses GitHub Actions to radically streamline and simplify WordPress plugin release management.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Automating Your Workflow With GitHub Actions</strong><br>
GitHub Actions enables you to create <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions">custom software development life cycle (SDLC)</a> workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a WordPress core lead developer and Director of Open Source Initiatives at 10up, I immediately saw the opportunity to use GitHub Actions to make specific tasks easier for WordPress plugin developers, like deploying a plugin and its assets/readme updates to the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress.org plugin repository</a>. </p>
<p>We <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2019/introducing-github-actions-for-wordpress-plugins/">previously introduced</a> early versions of these Actions, and now they’re ready for primetime following the announcement of <a href="https://github.blog/2019-11-14-powering-community-led-innovation-with-github-actions/">general availability of GitHub Actions</a> — an announcement that took the time to spotlight our “WordPress publishing” solution:</p>

By releasing our best practices, we hope to provide a guide for the establishment and ownership of open-source projects.</p>

<p>When discussing website performance, most people zero in on page load speed and the front-end user experience. This approach, however, ignores a critical subset of people interacting with the website—content creators working in the content management system (CMS). In a <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/10up-uses-new-relic-to-help-website-content-creators/">guest post published on the official New Relic blog</a>, I share how 10up leveraged New Relic tools to better support content creators and empower them to work more efficiently through back-end performance improvements.</p>
<p>10up uses New Relic’s performance monitoring to acquire real-time and trending data that can be used to troubleshoot performance challenges and diagnose problems quickly, which in turn, saves time and reduces cost.</p>

<p>10up aims to make a better web through finely crafted websites, innovative tools for content creators, and open-source contributions that drive growth. As a leading contributor to WordPress and the greater open-source community, the creation and sharing of open platforms and tools is a large part of our identity.</p>
<p><strong>The establishment of an official Open Source Practice within 10up demonstrates our commitment to advance open-source technology, lead by example, and grow the community of which we are proud to be a part and upon whose shoulders we stand.</strong></p>
<p>We have long utilized employee downtime between client projects for open-source contribution. Earlier this year, I joined the team as <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-jeff-paul">Open Source Practice Manager</a>. I work most closely with <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-helen-hou-sandi">Helen Hou-Sandí</a>, our Director of Open Source Initiatives, and <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-adam-silverstein">Adam Silverstein</a>, a Lead Open Source Initiatives Engineer, both of whom primarily focus on open source and contribution. That core team is augmented by additional 10uppers, some of whom have dedicated recurring time carved out for open source initiatives, and some of whom join our efforts for discrete projects. Collectively, 10up invests more than 350 hours every month into our open source initiatives.</p>

Last week, we released <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-special-characters/">Insert Special Characters</a>, a plugin that brings a special characters menu to the new WordPress block editor. </p>
<p>The new WordPress editor (aka Gutenberg) introduced a modern, block-based paradigm for visually authoring content. For all of its advancements, a button to insert special characters was not carried over from the classic editing experience—a feature critical to writers and publishers frequently using mathematical notation or other symbols. <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1678">Feedback concerning its absence</a> and some client questions inspired our Open Source Practice to take action.</p>

<p>From its conception, 10up has worked with vital publishers and content creators to improve storytelling across the web. This week I’m in Columbus, Ohio to participate in the third annual <a href="https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers</a>—a conference bringing together content creators using WordPress to manage and grow publications of all sizes. Thursday, I’ll be delivering the lightning talk “<a href="https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org/session/thursday-lightning-talks/">#NoStalking</a>,” about the challenges of delivering advertising that drives revenue but also respects user privacy.</p>

<p>There are several ways to handle CSS architecture within JavaScript applications. While considered a controversial topic among front-end developers, it’s important to remember that each method, whether in a React, Vue, or Angular application, has its own merits and inefficiencies. In a recent article for CSS-Tricks (one of the leading digital publications covering web technologies), I explore CSS architecture and the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-many-ways-to-include-css-in-javascript-applications/">many ways to include CSS in JavaScript Applications</a>—from using an external stylesheet, to creating CSS Modules, or writing CSS-in-JS.</p>

<p>Every year, 10uppers across the globe volunteer, speak at, and organize dozens of industry events. Whether its a local WordCamp or national jsConf, a niche conference like Write the Docs or an expansive one like CMS Expo, we make the time to <a href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">give back to open-source</a> and share our expertise. </p>
<p>Given our portfolio of client projects and partnerships in higher education, we’re thrilled to once again be a part of <a href="https://2019.wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>, a three-day conference dedicated to the confluence of WordPress in higher education, taking place July 25-27, 2019 at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.drive.ai/">Drive.ai</a> uses artificial intelligence to create self-driving cars. <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, a nonprofit research company backed by Elon Musk, created an artificial intelligence model called GPT2 that can generate text relevant to topic, tone, and feeling based on only a few words. Navigation services use artificial intelligence to decipher hundreds of thousands of data points to provide real-time traffic data.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are revolutionizing technology and when applied to digital publishing, the opportunities available to streamline internal workflows, enhance visitor experiences, and increase revenue are endless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning</strong><br>
<em>AI is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Machine learning is a subset of AI with the ability to <a href="https://skymind.ai/wiki/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning">modify itself when exposed to more data</a>; i.e. machine learning is dynamic and does not require human intervention to make certain changes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search engines like Google rely on AI and machine learning to “understand” what your content and site are about and how it should be ranked. But have you ever wondered if search engines interpret your content the same way you do? Or have you ever considered how these cutting edge technologies could be used to improve your content strategy or reduce resources?</p>
<p>These are the questions we’re asking at 10up as we look to the future of publishing technology and explore practical solutions that streamline editorial processes, increase audience engagement, and boost profits—solutions like our new plugin ClassifAI.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://classifaiplugin.com/">ClassifAI</a> is a free, open-source plugin that leverages leading cloud-based services like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/">Microsoft Azure AI</a> to augment WordPress-powered websites with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology.</strong></p>
<p>With years of experience working with some of the largest digital content creators, 10up understands that AI and machine learning will play an important role in the future of content creation and website experiences and we’re committed to driving this technology forward in the WordPress community. Today we are excited to share merely the first steps for ClassifAI: <strong>automated content tagging and classification</strong> as well as the <strong>automatic creation of image ALT text</strong>.</p>

<p>I recently contributed an article to <em>Get Started With Gutenberg</em>, a free publication produced by <a href="https://www.heartinternet.uk/">Heart Internet</a>. <em>Jumpstart Your Gutenberg Designs With SketchPress</em> provides a detailed tutorial on using <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2018/wordpress-wireframes-sketch/">SketchPress</a>: a library of WordPress admin interfaces, symbols, and icons for use with the popular design toolkit, Sketch. With SketchPress designers can create high-fidelity mockups of custom blocks and other editorial interfaces for both Gutenberg and classic versions of the WordPress admin. SketchPress and other <a href="https://github.com/10up">open-source projects from 10up</a> are <a href="https://github.com/10up/SketchPress">available on GitHub</a>. You can pick up a copy of the book at WordCamp Europe or <a href="https://www.heartinternet.uk/blog/download-your-free-get-started-with-gutenberg-ebook/">download the digital copy</a>.</p>

<p>From speaking and delivering product demos to volunteering at contributor day, #team10up is excited to be part of <a href="https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2019</a>, a WordPress conference happening June 21-22 in Berlin, Germany that attracts more than 2,000 attendees.</p>
<p>Contributing to communities that value an open web is <a href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">a big part of our identity</a>, and we can’t wait to share insights and collectively further the WordPress project. Several 10uppers, including myself and Brent van Rensburg, Director of Engineering, will be roaming the event, presenting, and lending a hand at the Google booth.</p>

<p>The best talent isn’t found in a single zip code and an international clientele requires a global perspective. Independence from traditional “brick and mortar” offices, freedom from commutes, and flexible schedules across nearly a dozen time zones mean we work when and where we’re most inspired and are available when our clients need us. At 10up, we’re advocates for remote work and know how to make it succeed for the company and the individual.</p>

<p>Iconography design might seem an uncommon undertaking for a developer, but <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-nate-allen">Senior Engineer Nate Allen</a> recently saw an opportunity to make <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/">WordPress’s Dashicon library</a> more inclusive. He took the initiative to tackle the design challenge himself, learning Adobe Illustrator in order to supplement the existing “businessman” icon with additional icons for “businesswoman” and “businessperson.” These icons, along with many more new icons, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/">will be released with WordPress 5.2</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Prior to the release of WordPress 5.0, I conducted a survey asking WordPress users with Gutenberg experience to offer their perspective on the new editor. The survey was conducted as part of a broader user-research effort designed to understand more about how content publishers view page-building and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2018/11/30/exploring-sitebuilding-via-user-research/">site-building</a> tools, and how the new content editor matches expectations. This research was intended to explore the behaviors and opinions of people who had already tried Gutenberg. Updates to the new editor based on this research are being tracked on <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">Github</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/">MakeWordPress.org</a>.</p>

<p>Do you develop your WordPress plugins on GitHub? Then here’s a treat for you! We’re excited to release a GitHub Action that <a href="https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress">deploys to the WordPress.org Plugin Repository</a> whenever you tag a new version on GitHub. You’ll be able to manage your entire development lifecycle in GitHub—no more futzing with local Bash scripts or controlling commit/push access in multiple places.</p>
<p>Keep reading for more details about GitHub Actions and how to get set up, but the gist is this: you reference our action in your plugin repo’s workflow file, filtered to only run when a tag is pushed, and set your username/password secrets. After that, each time you tag a new version on GitHub, whether by pushing a Git tag from the command line or making one using the GitHub releases interface, your plugin will be deployed to WordPress.org.</p>

<p>10up’s eighth year saw significant team and financial growth, all while we renewed our dedication to the values of openness and ownership. Our ethos of collective ownership drove us to find creative solutions, looking beyond the short-term to consider how our ideas scale, fit into product roadmaps, or impact the overall technology stack. And through it all, we <strong>increased revenue</strong> and <strong>grew our team</strong>—each by 30%—and <strong>welcomed more than 40 new</strong> clients across industries as diverse as <strong>media, publishing, high-tech, finance, food &amp; beverage, and architecture</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/10up/wpacceptance">WP Acceptance</a>—a team-centric tool we’ve built for writing reliable, scalable acceptance tests—is now available in beta</strong>. Part of our pursuit of finely crafted web experiences, we think that WP Acceptance will help ensure stable releases and fewer regressions for WordPress applications. <a href="https://wpacceptance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#wp-acceptance">This toolkit</a> lets developers and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/ci-cd/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html">continuous integration (CI) pipelines</a> test codebases through version-controlled acceptance tests and sharable, defined file and database snapshots.</p>
<p><strong>We’re considering this a public beta release</strong>. It won’t adversely affect your application or introduce instability, but it has not yet been thoroughly tested as a framework and may have some bugs. Through our own testing and community involvement, we’ll further solidify WP Acceptance as it approaches a full, public release.</p>

<p>#team10up is returning to Nashville for <a href="https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US 2018</a>, the largest official WordPress conference hosted in the United States! Being part of the open-source community is a <a href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">big part of our identity</a>, and we’re especially happy to be participating in so many ways this year, from speaking, to co-sponsoring events, to facilitating and attending, we’re here to immerse ourselves and help foster a great event.</p>
<h2>Presenting</h2>
<p>Helen Hou-Sandi, our Director of Open Source Initiatives, will be speaking on Saturday, December 8th at 11 a.m. Through her work building editorial experiences in WordPress core and for 10up solutions, Helen has seen the need to innovate beyond familiar UI elements like metaboxes, which are sometimes overly relied upon. In “<a href="https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/metaboxes-considered-harmful/">Metaboxes Considered Harmful</a>” she’ll be reviewing some creative solutions from the past that have broken outside of the bounds of metaboxes and other form-centric interfaces while still maintaining that WordPress “feel.” She will look at practical examples where rethinking the editorial experience and interface led to significantly better outcomes for both builders and content creators alike.</p>
<p>After her talk, she’ll be at the Happiness Bar until lunch to chat and answer any questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/"><b>The WordPress Design Team</b></a> recently had an in-depth conversation in <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7602">Github</a> about <b>enhancing the publisher flow in Gutenberg</b>. After watching Gutenberg go through several iterations since <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2018/user-testing-gutenberg/">our last user test</a>, I decided to try testing the current flow to see how well it was received by publishers. I hoped to identify friction or pain points in the Gutenberg authoring experience in the interests of helping refine the publishing flow.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce that <strong><a href="https://distributorplugin.com/">Distributor</a> has exited beta and is now openly available</strong>. Distributor is a free WordPress plugin that makes it easy to syndicate and reuse content across your websites—whether in a single multisite network or across the web with the REST API.</p>
<p>With Distributor, content creators can “push” or “pull” content between multiple sites, while retaining updates from the original source and preserving SEO. Copy, media, metadata, and categories all come along, and our fully extensible, open-source code base empowers developers to adapt it to even the most complicated workflows. <strong>To get the release version, and enable simple updates, <a href="https://distributorplugin.com/#cta">head to DistributorPlugin.com and fill out the short registration form</a></strong>.</p>
<p>More than 100 organizations and developers participated in our <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/distributor-plugin/">Distributor beta program</a>. Their feedback has helped us ensure that Distributor can be the trusted solution for sharing content between WordPress sites. We’ve already integrated many improvements contributed by beta testers, including 10up clients. Distributor has been approved for use on <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a> and is ready for enterprise implementations. We have a roadmap of planned enhancements, with ambitious plans including more advanced media distribution and sophisticated “take down” features for the forced removal of distributed content.</p>

<p>Kanye has nothing on 10up. Just a few days after the rapper <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/what-we-saw-at-kanyes-ye-listening-party-in-wyoming/">debuted his new album near Jackson Hole, Wyoming</a>, 10uppers from all over the world descended on <a href="https://www.springcreekranch.com/">Spring Creek Ranch</a>&nbsp;for our largest All Hands Summit yet. This coming together of our team—and a few clients and partners—spanned two full days of conference-like programming, followed by another two days of team-centric activities and bonding in an inspiring setting among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog">whistle pigs</a> and prairie grasses.</p>
<p>This annual event provides an opportunity to step away from our home offices, webcams, and daily routines to inhabit a space, share insights with each other, form enduring memories, and build on a common vision for our team and clients.</p>

<p>When a client with several podcasts expressed interest in a simple way to manage their casts from within WordPress, we began with a review of existing solutions and plugins. We quickly identified a gap between bare bones plugins supporting a single feed and complicated plugins designed for advanced workflows, such as sponsor management. To fill that void, we created <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-podcasting/">Simple Podcasting</a>, an intuitive, lightweight, and forward looking plugin that includes <strong>beta support for Gutenberg</strong>.<a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/media-and-entertainment-82693"><br>
</a></p>
<p>Our client’s ideal user story seemed common enough: they offer several podcasts across a network of news sites, with some sites featuring multiple podcasts. They wanted to fully manage and distribute their podcast feeds inside of WordPress, albeit sometimes hosting the media itself externally. Podcasts episodes would be managed as regular posts, and appear alongside their other news, enabling visitors to play an episode right from the website or by subscribing in iTunes or any other “podcatcher.”</p>

<p>A new WordPress content editing experience—<a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>—is <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare">coming soon to WordPress core</a>, and 10up’s User Experience team is eager to understand how it will impact the experience for content creators. As a starting point, I <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2018/usability-test-gutenberg/">created a usability test</a> to study the experiences of professional, digital content publishers who are used to writing stories in the current editor. Building on other <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/2017/11/22/testing-flow-in-gutenberg/">Gutenberg usability tests</a> that focused on re-creating a prescribed layout, I instead asked professional writers to produce the same kind of content they already produce every day: write a simple story.</p>
<p>The user test asked ten participants to complete the following prompt:</p>
<p><em>Write a news-style blog post about somewhere interesting you have visited. Please include the following elements in your post:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A title</em></li>
<li><em>A paragraph or two about the place</em></li>
<li><em>An image</em></li>
<li><em>An extra item such as a video or blockquote</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These tests were taken with Gutenberg 2.9.2 (the current build at the time the test was created). As of this post, the current version is 3.0.1.</p>
<p>During the unmoderated test, participants described what they were thinking as they progressed through the task. Their words and screen movements were recorded with permission.</p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>, a digital design app for macOS, enables the the rapid creation of wireframes using libraries of symbols and and reusable design elements. 10up has extended these capabilities with <a href="https://github.com/10up/SketchPress"><b>SketchPress</b></a><b>: a library of WordPress admin interfaces, symbols, and icons</b>. When wireframing admin interfaces, SketchPress frees up our designers’ time to focus on big picture problem solving and user experience challenges, rather than the repetitive minutia of button treatments and existing page layouts.</p>
<p>Recently, SketchPress was <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2018/06/07/design-meeting-notes-for-june-6-2018/">recognized as the preferred admin wireframing resource</a> by Make WordPress Design – the official core WordPress design team – and is now listed&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/c/6bGz7i3H/142-wordpress-admin-interface-in-sketch-10up">on their official Trello project board</a>. This endorsement validates the utility of the project while inspiring us to continue iterating. We value feedback, contribution, and adoption by the community as we seek to share high quality open-source design resources as part of our commitment to openness and giving back.</p>
<h2>Getting started with SketchPress</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/10up/SketchPress">Download SketchPress from GitHub</a> and open it in Sketch. You’ll see a number of pages down the left side of the interface. The first page is an introduction to the document and outlines information about what is included. If &nbsp;you plan to regularly use SketchPress, you’ll probably want to set it up in the templates folder: clone or download the repo directly into the Sketch templates folder, and you can to begin a new Sketch wireframe from the newly-saved template. Add or remove elements to begin modeling WordPress admin interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>We’re conducting a professional usability study on the current build of Gutenberg.</strong> Our goal is to augment existing user testing to better understand a particular subset of the user base: professionals who write and edit relatively standard, news-style content inside of WordPress. We want to observe how this audience perceives and adjusts to this new experience by watching them use it to create some basic content. Our ideal participant has experience creating content with WordPress, and brings a reasonably fresh and unbiased experience to Gutenberg.</p>

One year ago, we introduced <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/wp-docker/">WP Local Docker</a>, a lightweight local development alternative to VVV, another popular project <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">started by 10up</a>. A more recent project, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/wp-snapshots-share-wordpress-setup/">WP Snapshots</a>, efficiently pushes project snapshots into the cloud.</p>
<p>As we increasingly used WP Local Docker and WP Snapshots in conjunction, we discovered some technical obstacles that could make WP Snapshots difficult to use. We realized that bundling the two projects would solve those problems and offer value to anyone already using both projects.</p>

</p>
<p>Last year, we found ourselves implementing <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/amp-google-publishers/">Google AMP</a> for a client who often includes content with mathematical formulas. The formulas were implemented using the open <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML standard</a>, by way of the open source, JavaScript-based <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax engine</a>. Working around AMP’s JavaScript restriction, we put the formulas into <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-iframe">amp-iframe components</a>, which allow for arbitrary JavaScript execution. This workaround posed some limitations that compromised the design: formulas could not be displayed inline (inside of a paragraph), creating a slightly awkward aesthetic that didn’t quite match up with the “full” site’s presentation.</p>
<p>As a regular open source contributor committed to making a better web, it seemed to me that a native AMP implementation of the MathML standard would solve our client’s layout problem and help other developers and site owners. After a bit of background research, I opened an issue on Google’s open source <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/12800">AMP HTML project</a>.</p>
<p>With a prompt and warm welcome, Google’s team accepted my feature request. This being an <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml#wed-love-your-help-making-amp-better">open source project</a>, I volunteered to help; my offer was greeted with enthusiasm and some tips.</p>

<p>In our seventh year, we built on our <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/six-year-anniversary/">investment in culture and storytelling</a> by expanding our team and depth of services, and by redoubling our investments in open source and creativity.</p>
<p>We welcomed <strong>more than 30 new clients</strong> to our portfolio in another record sales year. We launched new websites along with web and mobile apps for major brands across <strong>verticals as diverse as finance, healthcare, academia, high-tech, big media, consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and fitness</strong>… to name a few.</p>
<p>In a milestone event, we completed <strong>an <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/10up-acquires-lift-ux/">acquisition of Lift UX</a>, a boutique, Emmy-nominated agency</strong> that focused on user experience for design-driven websites powered by WordPress. Intended to strengthen our experience design expertise and resources, this investment added executive design leadership and expanded our portfolio of design stories.</p>
<p>A renewed approach to <strong>our All Hands Summit yielded our largest and most memorable team event</strong> to date. Held in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, our team gathered from around the world to take over a former <a href="http://www.elconvento.com/">Carmelite convent</a> for a week of learning, sharing, building memories together, uniting around company goals, and celebrating our successes. Among the conference highlights, we held our first client panel, featuring leaders from companies like Microsoft, McClatchy, and Beasley Radio sharing insights on agency partnerships.</p>

<p>Earlier this week one of our partners, WP Engine, released a plugin that leverages Amazon Polly to transform written content into lifelike speech, directly from WordPress. Being dedicated to helping our clients deliver great digital content experiences, we were eager to help pilot this integration with WP Engine by finding a launch partner. Collaborating with POLITICO in Europe, we transformed their daily political newsletters – Brussels Playbook and London Playbook – into engaging podcasts.</p>
<p>Here’s what POLITICO had to say about their new integration, in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005136/en/WP-Engine-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-Voice">WP Engine’s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our readers are digesting news and stories through their mobile and voice-driven devices more and more,” said Johannes Boege, Chief Product Officer at POLITICO in Europe. “This is a great opportunity for us along with our agency 10up to test the distribution of our content with voice technology. We are excited to use Amazon Polly to reach more people in new ways.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As announced in <strong>June, beginning February 15th <a href="https://support.google.com/webtools/answer/7308033?vid=0-1088244580613-1515531967670">Chrome will remove all ads on websites</a> that do not meet the <a href="https://www.betterads.org/standards/">standards of the Coalition for Better Ads</a></strong>. Sites will have 30 days to address any issues flagged in Google’s compliance report before Chrome begins removing ads.</p>
<p>Google started this initiative in response to a report suggesting that poor ad experiences are responsible for a <a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/adblockreport/">30% increase in the use of ad blocking extensions</a> across the web, which “<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/improving-advertising-on-web.html">reduces the ability for publishers to continue creating free content and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem.</a>” Google is also on the board of the Coalition for Better Ad Standards.</p>
<p>The Coalition for Better Ads is made up of leading international trade associations and online media companies committed to supporting “<a href="https://www.betterads.org/">valuable free content, robust journalism and social connections across the internet</a>” through the use of online ads. Their vision for better online ads&nbsp;aligns with Google’s view, and led Google to join the effort to improve how people experience the web. Knowing that consumers are increasingly frustrated with web ads, the Coalition for Better Ads surveyed over <a href="https://www.betterads.org/research/">25,000 internet users</a> to create a set of consumer-friendly standards. Google will apply these standards to review a subset of a site’s pages.</p>

<p>New Relic has included our <a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-newrelic">New Relic Reporting for WordPress plugin</a> in <a href="https://newrelic.com/connect/details#wpnewrelic">New Relic Connect</a>, a directory that collects recommended integrations for New Relic customers. This plugin makes important WordPress data available in New Relic APM and Insights.

<p>Modern websites can be complex, especially when a high traffic site offers advanced features that need more intensive server processing. WordPress has a few tricks up its sleeve to help developers improve performance, but as we’ve <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/engineering-challenges-caching/">written about before</a>, those tricks don’t always scale.</p>
<p>If you’ve been engineering performant sites with WordPress, you’ve probably encountered the Transients API—a basic caching method. What developers may not know is, at scale, the synchronous way WordPress handles transients can lead to performance issues that can result in a poor user experience. That’s where <a href="https://github.com/10up/Async-Transients">Async Transients</a> comes in, our open-source Composer library for WordPress transients.<br>

<p>With the holidays revving up, 10uppers are taking some time to wind down and recharge before coming back in the new year. We’ll be on break from Friday, December 22nd, through Monday, January 1st, and back at it on Tuesday, January 2nd.</p>
<p>We thought we’d turn last year’s <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/2016-holiday-schedule/">holiday break post</a> into a tradition, so we asked some of our team: what are we doing while we’re away from our keyboards for 11 days?</p>

<p>We’d like to introduce you to our latest open source project: <a href="http://github.com/10up/wpsnapshots" rel="noopener">WP Snapshots</a>.</p>
<p>WP Snapshots is a <strong>command line interface (CLI) tool that empowers engineering teams to quickly share WordPress projects</strong> – including files and the database. Up until now, onboarding a new engineer onto a project has been tedious: he or she had to setup a local development environment, check out repositories, install matching versions of WordPress and any plugins, track down and import database dumps, copy over uploaded media, search and replace paths in the database, and so on. <strong>WP Snapshots turns a painstaking process into a few simple commands.</strong></p>

<p>Think about those times when ads were intrusive as you read a story on the web: perhaps a distracting video ad interrupting paragraphs just as you were becoming immersed in the narrative, or a tone-deaf ad showing up alongside coverage of a somber event. If you’re a content creator or publisher, think about the times when the “it’s a surprise!” nature of programmatically inserted ads has been a pain point.</p>
<p>As content management systems (CMS) increasingly move to “block-based” editors that are much more visually representative of the final state on the front end, we have an opportunity to design tools that better recognize and integrate advertisements as part of the editorial process. <strong>Rather than treating ads as an afterthought, what if we start treating them as a fully integrated component of the content as it’s constructed?</strong></p>
<p>With our preferred CMS – WordPress –&nbsp;heavily investing in a new block-based editor, code-named <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg,</a> our Revenue Strategists and Platform team saw an opportunity to contribute by experimenting with handling ad placement inside of the editor. At the heart of Gutenberg is a block-based method of creating and managing your content, shifting to a unified site-wide “block” concept that further empowers content creators to make their work look just the way they want. We thought: <strong>shouldn’t advertisements be one of those blocks?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meet the newest addition to 10up’s suite of powerful, open source tools for content creators and managers: <a href="https://distributorplugin.com/">Distributor</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Distributor is a WordPress plugin that <strong>empowers content managers to safely reuse and syndicate content across their websites</strong>, supporting sites within a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network">WordPress multisite network</a> and across the web using the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a>. Designed with an <strong>intuitive user experience</strong> at the forefront, Distributor integrates “push” and “pull” use cases.</p>
<p>The sharing interface is accessible from the admin bar when viewing a single piece of content in the editor or on the front end. Without leaving the content – and with just a couple of clicks – content managers can “push” the content to any other sites where he or she has permission to publish. <strong>Think of it as a “retweet” feature for your WordPress sites.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service</strong> (to our clients, our colleagues, and our communities) is one of 10up’s core values, and one way we see that value made concrete is in sponsoring and speaking at various conferences connected to WordPress, content publishing, and generally making the web a better place.</p>
<p>This fall has been especially busy – so much so we’ve neglected to share updates here.</p>
<h2>Upcoming:</h2>
<p>Gabe Karp, 10up’s Business Director in Europe, will be speaking next week at <a href="https://websummit.com/">Web Summit 2017</a> in Lisbon.&nbsp;The “largest tech conference in the world,” WebSummit brings 25 different conferences together in one physical space over 4 days. Gabe will be part of a Marketing Technology panel in the Growth Summit track on Nov. 7th</p>
<p>10up is excited to sponsor <a href="https://tp.ticketleap.com/kleincamp17/">Klein News Innovation Camp</a> (formerly Barcamp News Innovation), an open, unconference style event being held at Temple University in Philadelphia on November 4th, focused on the future of news and how we can improve communities and conversations across the web. I’m looking forward to participating personally – let me know on twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/jeckman/">@jeckman</a>) if you’ll be there as well.<br>

<p>The first WordCamp curated for publishers begins Thursday in Denver, and features sessions&nbsp;for engineering, product, and editorial teams at news rooms big and small.</p>
<p>With our mission to make a better web for content creators, it’s no surprise that many of our clients are publishers, from storied giants like The New York Times and Time Inc to breakout digital voices like 9to5mac and Uproxx. Combined with our committed support for open platforms like WordPress, we’re proud&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/sponsors/">Gold Sponsors</a> of&nbsp;WordCamp for Publishers</strong>, the highest tier publicly offered.</p>
<p>I’ll be participating in the event along with fellow 10uppers Ben Ilfeld, Whitney Yadrich, Jay Moore, and Derrick Koo. We’re eager to learn, and eager to share: <strong>four of us will present at the event</strong>.</p>

<p>We’re delighted to announce that after nearly one year of discussion and due diligence, <strong>10up has completed an acquisition of <a href="https://liftux.com/10up">Lift UX</a>: a boutique, distributed, Emmy-nominated agency</strong> that specializes in making user experience design driven websites powered by WordPress. The Lift team, including its founding partners, Chris Wallace and Brad Miller, join 10up effective immediately.</p>
<p>Founded as a boutique digital creative shop in 2009, Lift has delivered web projects for clients like Frito-Lay, The Next Web, eBay, GoDaddy, and Disney. Lift earned acclaim when a “second screen” experience built for AMC’s Walking Dead was <a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead/talk/2013/07/the-walking-dead-the-walking-dead-story-sync-get-emmy-nominations">nominated for an Emmy Award</a> in the interactive program category in 2012. Their work earn a second nomination in 2015 for <a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/talk/2015/07/mad-men-receives-11-emmy-nominations-remains-the-most-nominated-basic-cable-drama-of-all-time">Mad Men: The Fan Cut</a>. Among their innovations, Lift built and sold a WordPress themes shop (UpThemes), and started a career center for distributed companies, <a href="http://remotejobs.com/">RemoteJobs.com</a>. They recently launched <a href="http://campusinsiders.com/">CampusInsiders.com</a>, a project spotlighted by Automattic’s <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> VIP program; the project earned Lift an invitation to become an official VIP agency partner.</p>
<p>As 10up’s President &amp; Founder, I am elated to welcome this outstanding team, award recognized portfolio, and client roster to the 10up family. This acquisition <strong>accelerates our growth in Experience Design</strong>, adding executive-tier design leadership and enriching our growing portfolio of design stories. It represents a special opportunity for all parties to go further and faster as we partner with clients to make a better web.</p>

<p>We’ve released a major update to <a href="https://10up.com/plugins/restricted-site-access-wordpress/">Restricted Site Access</a>, our popular WordPress plugin that intelligently limits website access. Designed to keep unwanted visitors out of staging, test, and private sites, the plugin is active on more than 20,000 websites and has a 5 star rating.</p>
<p>Restricted Site Access 6.0 adds full support for <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network">WordPress network (multisite) installations</a>. Network administrators can enforce restriction rules across the entire network, or set default restriction rules that are applied as new sites are added. If you have a network of private blogs or internal sites, or need time to configure new sites in your network before taking them live, this is the update you’ve been waiting for.</p>

<blockquote><p>“In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”<br>
–<strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Why we estimate</h2>
<blockquote><p>Suppose you’re preparing for a trip and deciding which suitcase to take. You have a small suitcase that you like because it’s easy to carry and will fit into an airplane’s overhead storage bin. You also have a large suitcase, which you don’t like because you’ll have to check it in and then wait for it at baggage claim, lengthening your trip. You lay your clothes beside the small suitcase, and it appears that they will almost fit. What do you do? You might try packing them very carefully, not wasting any space, and hoping they all fit. If that approach doesn’t work, you might try stuffing them into the suitcase with brute force, sitting on the top and trying to squeeze the latches closed. If that still doesn’t work, you’re faced with a choice: leave a few clothes at home or take the larger suitcase. —<strong>Steve McConnell, <em>Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As an engineer, nothing pleases me more than rolling up my sleeves and writing code. But before doing that, a sense of how to approach a task and the required resources (people, time, software licenses, third-party API access) need to be determined. These details support clear project expectations, which are foundational to the great client experiences we strive to create. Estimates, give all project stakeholders—internal and external—a chance to agree on a few key things before work is begun:</p>
<ul>
<li>That we understand what is being asked for;</li>
<li>That we have a plan to efficiently deliver quality results;</li>
<li>That we’ve asked (and answered) all project team questions;</li>
<li>That we’ve considered all the risks, edge cases, and alternatives;</li>
<li>That we’ve considered the effects on usability, accessibility, and SEO;</li>
<li>That the available budget and desired timeline support the approach.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic</a> is a SaaS product that offers application performance monitoring (APM), which provides developers with real-time data for use in proactive diagnostics as well as debugging. This data—including basic information about <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/frameworks-libraries/wordpress-specific-functionality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes</a>—can be queried and visualized using the <a href="https://newrelic.com/insights/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Insights</a> dashboard.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity to maximize the utility of APM and Insights, we created <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-newrelic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Reporting for WordPress</a>, which supplements out-of-the-box data collection with additional WordPress-specific information.</p>

<p>Back in 2013, 10up introduced Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), a <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/" target="_blank">project led by then 10upper Jeremy Felt</a>. One of the first popular WordPress development environments based on Vagrant, VVV has since been moved out of 10up’s GitHub and into its <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">own</a>, where it continues to thrive as a community-led project.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> and container-based server architectures have emerged as powerful tools for creating and managing development environments. Last year, we partnered with Joyent to release a <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/joyent-wordpress-docker/" target="_blank">scalable, production-ready Docker environment for WordPress</a>. Today, we’re proud to release <strong><a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-docker" target="_blank">WP Docker</a>: an open source Docker configuration optimized for local WordPress development.</strong><br>

<blockquote><p>[To better illustrate our core value of community service, we are sharing an internal post from Senior Front End Engineer Derrick Koo, who recently made his first code contribution to the WordPress project. We hope his story encourages more people who are “on the fence” about contributing to take the plunge and start giving back to the WordPress community. —Jake Goldman, President &amp; Founder]</p></blockquote>
<p>Contributing code to WordPress Core can be intimidating for a first-timer. With <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/no-patch" target="_blank">thousands of tickets</a> out there, it can be hard to know where to begin. With development out in the open, it takes a lot of courage to submit a first WordPress patch.</p>
<p>For the benefit of new and aspiring contributors, I’m sharing my experience making my first code contribution to WordPress. Starting with little knowledge of the Core contribution process, I embarked on a journey that resulted in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38872#comment:10" target="_blank">one line of CSS, and my first Core props</a>.<br>

<p>When troubleshooting a slow WordPress site, an often overlooked culprit is the wp_options database table. This table houses a variety of crucial site data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>permalinks</li>
<li>site settings</li>
<li>scheduled posts</li>
<li>widget data</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, nearly every WordPress page—from the front end to the admin screens—executes the query <code class="language-php">SELECT option_name, option_value FROM wp_options WHERE autoload = 'yes'</code>. If this query does not run efficiently, <strong>the results can be devastating to a site’s speed</strong>.<br>

If we spent our first five years pioneering and staking our claim in the world, in our sixth year we cultivated the organization and culture we pioneered. We rallied around trends and shifts in our industry and redoubled our investment into telling our story.</p>
<p>The initiative to better express our story culminated in a <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/refined-message-website-design/" target="_blank">refresh of our company website</a>, prominently featuring a new mission statement, proudly summarized by a promise to deliver “finely crafted websites and tools that make the web better.” We reinvigorated our <a href="https://10up.com/our-work/" target="_blank">project case studies</a>, moving to a layout that better celebrates the challenges we’ve conquered with our clients. And we completely overhauled our <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2017/careers-2017/" target="_blank">Careers section</a>, taking deliberate strides to better represent our culture of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>All this while growing our revenue by 12%.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways we adapted to a shifting landscape and embodied our new mission since our <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/5-year-anniversary/" target="_blank">last company anniversary</a>:<br>

<p><strong>We’re proud to announce <a href="https://elasticpress.io/" target="_blank">ElasticPress.io</a>: a hosted service that integrates with <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/elasticpress-2-0/" target="_blank">ElasticPress</a>, our popular plugin, to provide a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress. </strong></p>
<p>We built ElasticPress to overcome higher-end performance and functional limits posed by the more traditional, structured (SQL) database underpinning WordPress. Storing content in a modern (noSQL) query engine like Elasticsearch empowers us to produce superior keyword search and related content results, and supercharge the performance of complex queries like a filter on multiple product properties or a location. Smarter and faster content makes for a better web and, not accidentally, is important to search engines and visitor retention / conversion. </p>
<p>While our plugin made it simple for WordPress-savvy engineers to talk to Elasticsearch, the need to manage Elasticsearch hosting added friction and complexity, at odds with the simple user experience 10up strives for. As we prototyped exciting use cases involving private content, we realized that end-to-end security added even more complexity. </p>
<p><strong>ElasticPress.io solves all of that</strong>—making it dead-simple to start using enterprise-caliber search and query technology with WordPress. It enables innovative features like accelerated admin performance that require end-to-end control and security.</p>

<p>We’re proud to introduce the <a href="https://10up.github.io/wp-component-library/">WordPress Component Library</a>: a collection of front-end components constructed with WordPress and accessibility at the forefront.</p>
<p>Many of the HTML and CSS components we build&nbsp;for our clients are structurally similar, particularly for prolific features like menus, search forms, posts, and blogrolls. A common starting point offers efficiencies to our clients while simultaneously raising the bar on polish and compliance with standards like accessibility. In evaluating existing libraries, we found&nbsp;that the industry was missing a good, open source project built with WordPress’s often opinionated markup (e.g. menus) and basic layout structure in mind.</p>

<p>Join team 10up (from wherever you are) on Dec 6 and 7 for the <a href="http://remoteworkingconf.com/" target="_blank">2016 Remote Working Conference</a>. This two-day <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYJHu1Y4AmM" target="_blank">streaming</a> event focuses on how to succeed in a remote working environment and will dispel the myths around distributed teams.</p>
<p>On Day 1, <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-john-eckman" target="_blank">John Eckman</a> will present “Distributed, not Disconnected: Employee Engagement for Remote Work.” Remote teams carry the stigma of being less connected than their co-located counterparts. John will share techniques and tools to drive engagement in a distributed workplace.</p>
<p>On Day 2, I close the event with my talk “Designing a Better UX Hiring Process.” Vetting UX applicants can be a challenge for remote agencies. Video interviews and online portfolios help, but cannot be the only metrics used to find the best UX design talent. In this talk, I’ll share our strategy for attracting and hiring top UX candidates.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Washington, D.C. NPR regional affiliate WAMU released a <a href="https://wamu.org/" target="_blank">fully reimagined website</a> in partnership with 10up. Designed to elegantly present written and audio content, we engineered a cutting-edge WordPress implementation that leverages React.js and the WordPress REST API to create an immersive single-page app experience. Visitors can listen to audio content using the player bar pinned to the bottom of the screen, without interruption, as they browse the site on a phone, tablet, or desktop browser.</p>

<p>Back in September, team 10up gathered in Atlanta from around the globe for four days of knowledge sharing, team building, and face-to-face time. Our days were filled with inspiring, educational presentations from our peers, while the evenings let us kick back and relax with teammates whom we normally only see on our computer screen.</p>
<p>The event began with an in-depth keynote presented by company leadership: our own 10up State of the Union. The keynote was followed by more than a dozen sessions presented by 10uppers who contributed their time and effort to share their knowledge, lessons learned, and perspective. Topics—to name a few—explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>new tools, best practices, and important concepts for engineering, user experience, and design;</li>
<li>techniques we can use to delight our clients;</li>
<li>lessons learned from projects;</li>
<li>the current and future state of content platforms and distribution;</li>
<li>ways to support more performant, effective web ads that are more profitable for publishers without sacrificing visitor engagement, and;</li>
<li>how to identify and manage impostor syndrome.</li>

</p>
<p>When collaborating with Microsoft, we are often responsible for making WordPress work seamlessly with Microsoft’s own offerings, including their <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Azure cloud service platform</a>. An ideal Azure hosting configuration leverages <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/#blob-storage" target="_blank">Azure Blob Storage</a> to store and deliver uploaded media assets and attachments. Microsoft’s existing, open source solution, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/windows-azure-storage/" target="_blank">Windows Azure Storage for WordPress</a>, had been neglected for years; we stepped up to overhaul the plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/windows-azure-storage/" target="_blank">4.0 release</a> addresses legacy SDK dependencies and features a refactored code base, bringing it in line with our <a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/" target="_blank">WordPress Best Practices</a>.</p>

<p>On October 25, the <a href="https://www.iab.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a> (IAB)—responsible for setting online ad guidelines and best practices—held a webinar to review an <a href="https://www.iab.com/newadportfolio" target="_blank">ambitious overhaul</a> of its Ad Standards Portfolio.</p>
<h2>So why the overhaul?</h2>
<p>The new portfolio of ad units aims to address concerning trends, including an increase in the <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2015/ios-9-content-blockers-analysis-whitepaper/" target="_blank">adoption of ad blockers</a> and <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/amp-google-publishers/" target="_blank">content delivery platforms</a> like Google AMP and Apple News that limit ad integrations. The IAB has <a href="https://www.iab.com/news/lean/" target="_blank">asserted</a> that, as publishers focused on margins and increased automation, their audiences have increasingly encountered invasive interstitials, purposefully-hidden opt-outs, auto-play videos, and recurring-ad fatigue. Sites have <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/new-years-resolutions-for-websites/" target="_blank">grown heavy</a> with extended load times often caused primarily by third-party ad servers and content discovery platforms like Outbrain and Taboola.</p>
<p>“We messed up,” <a href="https://www.iab.com/news/lean/" target="_blank">wrote</a> Scott Cunningham, Senior Vice President of Tech and Ad Ops at IAB. “As technologists tasked with delivering content and services to users, we lost track of the user experience.”</p>

As web technologies and mobile devices improve and global internet speeds increase, consumers increasingly expect taps and clicks to deliver results nearly instantaneously; the “app-like” experience has become an expectation in web browsers. To this end, we’ve seen huge strides forward in web platforms and frameworks.</p>
<p>Among its most notable relevant advancements, WordPress introduced a <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/" target="_blank">JSON REST API</a>, which opens up new, compelling use cases as a framework and content storage engine, such as <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/headless-cio-review/" target="_blank">headless publishing workflows</a>. However, since WordPress runs on PHP, it can’t be used in conjunction with an important breakthrough: <strong>isomorphic applications</strong>.</p>
<p>Isomorphic web applications run the same code on the server and client (web browser), providing the flexibility, extensibility, and consistency to build the most modern “app-like” experiences on the web. JavaScript and Node.js are used to create isomorphic applications, since JavaScript runs natively in the web browser and is the foundation for server-side Node.js. (<a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>&nbsp;about isomorphic applications.)</p>
<p>Since we can’t run PHP in the web browser, we have a few options for creating JavaScript-powered “app-like” experiences in WordPress.</p>

<p>I recently published an article on CIO Review discussing the <a href="http://enterprise-content-management.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/should-you-go-headless-leveraging-a-headless-cms-for-modern-digital-publishing-nid-23167-cid-129.html">benefits and challenges of implementing a headless publishing workflow</a>&nbsp;to better facilitate&nbsp;cross-channel and cross-platform content distribution.</p>
<p>Traditionally, content management systems handled both the management&nbsp;of content (the “backend”) and the presentation of content to audiences (the “front end”). By going headless, content creators&nbsp;decouple site backends from front ends, enabling many&nbsp;different content presentation applications –&nbsp;websites, mobile apps, social or syndication&nbsp;channels, etc –&nbsp;to&nbsp; consume content managed in a single backend.</p>
<p>Given the benefits laid out in my article, we’re increasingly encouraging 10up clients to consider “going headless” for their&nbsp;next site builds.</p>

<p>More than two years ago, we overhauled 10up.com to reflect the company we had become. Conceived and built entirely in-house, we strove for an experience and aesthetic that would project the craftsmanship we offer our clients. More than two years later, we think the art direction and architecture has more than withstood the test of time.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, our mission, message, and value proposition has evolved, presenting an opportunity to improve the way we articulate ourselves, in content and design. I’m happy to announce a site wide update that highlights our refreshed mission statement and improves the way we describe #team10up.</p>
<p>We think that our own story becomes most tangible when telling our project stories, so we’ve also taken the time to completely redesign our work portfolio.&nbsp;Our user experience and visual design team worked closely with internal stakeholders and engineers to craft a portfolio that is as visually stunning as it is functional, across screen sizes and device types.</p>

<p>ElasticPress 2.0 is a major update, with improvements to search result weighting, expanded query parameters, and better metadata syncing.</p>
<p>Tweaks to the search algorithm’s fuzzy matching limit unwanted results (i.e. searches for “yell” previously returned results for “yeti,” since the terms are only two characters apart) while still correcting for misspellings. Results are more intelligently weighted, with documents containing all search terms boosted 2x, and another 2x boost for documents matching the order of searched terms.</p>

Migrating a standalone WordPress site to a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network" target="_blank">site network (or “multisite”) environment</a> is a tedious and tricky endeavor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/" target="_blank">WordPress Importer</a> works reasonably well for smaller, simpler sites, but leaves room for improvement. It exports content, but not site configuration data such as Widget and Customizer configurations, plugins, and site settings. The Importer also struggles to handle a large amount of content. Third party backup plugins that are compatible with site networks offer another solution, but they often involve slow intermediary “cloud” backup and restore steps, and the reliable solutions are mostly commercial.<br>

</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that <strong>10up has partnered with Joyent to bring WordPress to their Docker infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joyent.com/" target="_blank">Joyent</a>, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS) company providing software to power their—and their clients’—cloud platforms, knows the difficulties in prepackaging software installations that can be readily moved across server environments. To solve this, Joyent uses <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a>, a technology which packages an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. In plain terms, it creates a fully assembled, preconfigured, and portable software environment.</p>
<p>Docker offers several practical benefits for teams building websites and applications using repeatable configurations and industry best practices like testing environments. First, as simple as the WordPress <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install" target="_blank">famous 5-minute install</a> is, it results in a default, out-of-the-box configuration; Docker helps engineers fast forward past the remaining configuration. Second, it ensures that multiple installations (local, staging, production, separate servers) mirror each other, so as to allow worry-free code deployments. We made inroads in solving this problem with <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>, and Docker takes that solution a step further.</p>

<p>WordPress is strongly represented among the <a href="https://pv.webbyawards.com/2016" target="_blank">2016 Annual Webby Awards</a>, powering 1 of every 7 nominees in the Website categories. Nominees span 32 of the 48 categories, recognizing websites marketing major financial institutions and web apps, superstar artists and musicians, government projects, and major media and news outlets.</p>
<p>With its intuitive interface, flexible code base, and focus on democratizing content creation, we’re not surprised to see our go-to CMS solution owning such a respectable percentage of the pack. 10up believes in open technology and we’re glad to see platforms such as WordPress in such high use.</p>

</p>
<p>When making copies of a website for development and testing, populating a thorough content and data set is vital for Quality Assurance (QA). The most efficient path typically involves mirroring the entire production site’s database. But this can be problematic: a large site can have tens of thousands of posts (each with many revisions and healthy doses of metadata) and many user accounts.</p>
<p>Those user accounts (and sometimes the site’s content) can contain sensitive data that, if mishandled, can put clients at risk. On top of that, testing, development, and initial imports—often executed on lightweight virtual machines—can be painfully slow when working with very large datasets. Cleaning up imported production data is a must, but has been a tedious, inefficient task.</p>
<p><strong>Enter 10up’s <a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-hammer" target="_blank">WP Hammer</a>: an open source developer tool that quickly and efficiently reduces—or completely removes—production data and sensitive client information</strong> like email addresses and hashed account passwords from a WordPress installation.<br>

<p>In 2014, we instituted <a href="https://www.rocketrip.com/" target="_blank">Rocketrip</a>, so that 10uppers could earn points for shared savings on business travel. These points could be redeemed for rewards like gift card and donations. Earlier this year, after we decided to sunset the program, our team had a few weeks to redeem their points.</p>
<p><strong>Something wonderful happened.</strong> A few of us decided to pool our points for a group charitable gift, spurring <em>dozens</em> of other 10uppers to donate their points to the pool. This week, we donated to <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> – whose mission is to close the gender gap in technology and engineering. We’re proud to support an organization consistent with our values, practices, and culture.</p>

All content creators, from enterprises posting corporate news to your neighbor’s food blog, can start taking advantage of the benefits of Facebook Instant Articles to maximize engagement with <a href="https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/" target="_blank">Facebook’s 1.5 billion users</a>.</p>
<p>We see Instant Articles as another step toward the content management system (CMS) as the hub for creating and delivering content. Content creators are distributing to many interfaces and channels: HTML/CSS front ends, mobile apps, third party sites, Google AMP, Apple News feeds…even <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2015/web-to-print-open-source/" target="_blank">print publications</a>! <strong>Rapidly evolving content distribution punctuates the benefits of an open and well-maintained CMS.</strong> WordPress adopters can rapidly benefit from channels like AMP and Instant Articles thanks to quickly released and well supported open source modules, circumventing the development overhead of a home grown platform or the long roadmap of a niche commercial CMS, and without surrendering their content to closed platforms like Medium.</p>
<p>Seamless integrations with platforms like Instant Articles is why 10up so fervently advocates for WordPress and the open web. And so, upon Facebook’s 12th anniversary, here are 12 key insights for publishers using WordPress and preparing for Facebook Instant Articles.</p>

<a href="https://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> is the world’s most popular e-commerce software, available as a free WordPress plugin. Its expansive extensions library houses a number of premium extensions addressing recurring payments, different payment gateways, shipment tracking tools, and more.</p>
<p>Scaling open source e-commerce solutions like WooCommerce, that can be installed on infrastructures of all shapes and sizes,&nbsp;is&nbsp;challenging. Online stores&nbsp;typically require intensive database transactions: complex queries on both the front and back-end that filter and sort products based on several categories, stock, and properties like pricing and reviews.</p>
<p>Further, most shoppers depend on site search to find products. Complex filters combined with keyword search across fields heavily tax relational databases like MySQL, the underlying database used by WordPress. And of course, increased store traffic increases the number of database queries to process, making every transaction even slower. Not surprisingly, many WooCommerce sites run quite slowly.</p>

<p>Since then, 10up has matured at a much faster pace than your average agency. We’ve continued to grow our team <strong>by ~30%, welcoming dozens of new 10uppers across Project Management, Web Strategy, Engineering, Design, Revenue, and User Experience</strong>. Financials also continue to thrive; <strong>in the first month of 2016</strong>, we saw <strong>more revenue than our first two years combined</strong> (and more than half of what we did in our third year).</p>
<p>But here at 10up, we value more than revenue and growth statistics—it’s about nurturing the culture within, providing our team the resources to achieve peak performance—a sense of community, a pride of ownership, and material benefits for a team that is building a future together, not merely cashing in a paycheck.</p>
<p>In 2015, we hosted our biggest <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2015/annual-summit-boulder/" target="_blank">All Hands Summit</a>, practically taking over a hotel in Boulder for a 10up-only conference with sessions exploring our business goals, emerging and important technologies, and the latest tactics for effective project management, with a healthy dose of team building. We even hosted an awards ceremony: The First Annual Uppies – a tradition is born.</p>

</p>
<p>We now spend more time on mobile gadgets than on desktop devices. The mobile web experience is more important than ever, and overwhelmingly defined by content relevancy, timeliness, and above all, speediness.</p>
<p>Mindful web developers—given adequate budget allowances—strive to build mobile-first sites that provide lean, engaging experiences across different screen sizes and devices. These sites better retain their audience because the experience is enjoyable and, in some cases, because impatient readers will leave (“bounce”) rather than wait for a clunky web page. Because Google recognizes its customers’ preference for performant sites, it factors pagespeed into its search algorithm, boosting speedy sites in search results.</p>
<p>In spite of these incentives to minimize page weight, most websites are <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2016/new-years-resolutions-for-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavier than ever</a>. High resolution displays ushered in huge images, and universal support for custom typography has us downloading fonts everywhere. While the renaissance in front end toolkits like jQuery and React.js eases development and alleviates server-side scaling, it has done so at the expense of pushing more assets and processor strain to the browser. Most problematically, today’s website monetization and measurement tools often deliver heavy (and invasive) ads with little incentive to improve.</p>
<p>Much of this “bloat” has been obfuscated by our increasingly powerful devices, improving mobile broadband connections (especially among the “creative” class), and increasingly competitive browser technology. Even so, publishers are clearly testing (or even lazily trampling) acceptable boundaries, creating an opening for ethically gray solutions like <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2015/ios-9-content-blockers-analysis-whitepaper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS 9’s content blockers</a>, and more closed platforms like Apple News.</p>
<p><strong>Enter the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project</a></strong>: an open source initiative based on existing open web standards led by Google, touting noble intentions to improve the mobile web experience by providing standardized, lightweight guidelines and tools for developers. AMP HTML versions of web pages trade complex functionality and capabilities for lightness, simplicity, and a focus on content, resulting in near instant load times.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16978" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM.png" alt="Accelerated Mobile Pages" width="2396" height="1418" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM.png 2396w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-300x178.png 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-768x455.png 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-756x447.png 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-210x124.png 210w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-292x172.png 292w, https://10up.com/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-3.29.39-PM-152x90.png 152w" sizes="(max-width: 2396px) 100vw, 2396px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>While there may be more transformative long-term potential for AMP as a framework, in the near-term, Google’s initiative is hyper-focused on improving news and media consumption. In essence, AMP competes with the self-contained, largely closed, and far more restrictive experiences offered by <a href="http://www.apple.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple News</a>, <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Instant Articles</a>, and the <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/longform-tweets-twitter-to-bump-character-limit-from-140-to-10000/632404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored “long-form format” coming to Twitter</a> (among others). Publishers opting to offer AMP’s lean presentation will be rewarded with increased visibility in mobile search results for news, including Google’s News Carousel: the highly coveted positioning at the top of mobile search results.</p>
<p>Backed by Google and already in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/support/faqs.html#who-will-be-able-to-use-accelerated-mobile-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta testing with some of the largest news organizations</a>, AMP is poised to become a standard feature for content-centric websites.</p>

</p>
<p>It’s&nbsp;an exciting time in the WordPress community, with the release&nbsp;of <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/" target="_blank">Calypso</a>, a successful inaugural <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a>, and <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/12/07/state-of-the-word-2015/" target="_blank">WordPress now powering 25% of all websites</a>. Maturation of the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress REST&nbsp;API</a> is enabling&nbsp;the decoupling of the content management layer from the&nbsp;display layer, which has the&nbsp;potential to further drive adoption; larger teams can write independent code that communicates via the API, reducing blockers and accelerating&nbsp;feature releases. At the same time, the entire Web is poised to undergo a metamorphosis, as HTTP/2 begins to fundamentally change how content is delivered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16830" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/banner-300x97.jpg" alt="WP REST API" width="300" height="97" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner-300x97.jpg 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner-768x249.jpg 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner-756x245.jpg 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner-220x71.jpg 220w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner-160x52.jpg 160w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/banner.jpg 1544w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">While these developments offer tremendous potential for those of us&nbsp;who work with WordPress for a living, I think there are some important considerations to keep in mind as WordPress and the Web move into a new era&nbsp;of maturity and possibility.</p>
<p><b>Using a CDN with DDoS protection is increasingly&nbsp;important</b></p>
<p>We recently started testing a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">CDN</a> service that offers <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html">DDoS</a> protection and mitigation for&nbsp;this site. While we hardly consider ourselves a high-profile target, the number of attacks reported by service is astonishing (more than a dozen every&nbsp;day, sometimes double or triple that). The majority are attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins (or other common web applications), such as those listed in the <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/">WP Vulnerability Database</a>. Exploit mitigation (or at least, notification) at the&nbsp;CDN layer provider is compelling.</p>
<p>In addition to protection from&nbsp;known vulnerabilities, CDNs are vital to accommodating significant burst traffic, and eliminate the effort involved in&nbsp;hosting sites in multiple datacenter across the world. Instead of scaling your servers to manage&nbsp;exponential traffic as a story goes viral or an online catalog gets slammed on Cyber Monday, the work is offloaded to the CDN and its network of edge servers.</p>
<p>Of course, a CDN might not speed up your site–in fact, it can&nbsp;do <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/blog/why-we-dont-use-a-cdn-spdy-ssl/">just the opposite</a> if you start serving up your site over&nbsp;HTTP/2 and you’re using “best practices” for optimizing your site for HTTP1.1.</p>

<p>The web publishing experience is at the heart of 10up’s&nbsp;mission. So needless to say, when&nbsp;<a href="http://observer.com/" target="_blank">Observer</a> (a long-time client) offered the opportunity to reimagine their editorial process, <strong>merging content management across their digital property and hallmark print publication</strong>,&nbsp;New York Observer, they couldn’t hold us back.</p>
<p>The existing process was relatively simple, but introduced several pain points and some potential for inaccuracy. Content was first authored in a word processor; it then moved through several teams and systems: from fact checkers to InDesign and InCopy, then to print, and finally to WordPress for publication on Observer.com. All of this was tracked in a spreadsheet, which involved manually copying and pasting between the word processor, spreadsheet, and WordPress. For a publisher doggedly moving to a “digital first” business model, their process hadn’t&nbsp;exactly caught up with&nbsp;their vision.</p>
<p>The 10up/Observer team came up with a better approach: let’s flip that process on its head and drive the entire process from within WordPress, taking advantage of its content authorship and storage capabilities! In doing so, the burden of duplicating content is removed, and content can be published online much more quickly, without waiting for print publication.</p>
<p><strong>The result? <a href="https://github.com/observermedia/eight-day-week" target="_blank">Eight Day Week</a>–a web to print plugin that helps digital content creators use WordPress to streamline their print production workflow.</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago,&nbsp;we pushed out our newest&nbsp;open source project: <a href="https://github.com/10up/flexibility">Flexibility</a>, a polyfill that back ports Flexbox support to Internet Explorer versions 8 and 9.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16678" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM.png" alt="Flexibility" width="1006" height="247" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM.png 1006w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM-300x74.png 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM-768x189.png 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM-756x186.png 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM-220x54.png 220w, https://10up.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-23-at-9.32.26-AM-160x39.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>Flexbox is one of the most significant advances in&nbsp;front end website layout since the advent of CSS, empowering us&nbsp;to build beautifully responsive and <em>flexible</em> layouts using pure, clean CSS.&nbsp;Here’s&nbsp;a short explanation from a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">great&nbsp;overview prepared by&nbsp;CSS-Tricks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Flexbox support wasn’t added to&nbsp;Internet Explorer until version 10, leaving older versions –&nbsp;still popular in some corners –&nbsp;out of the Flexbox revolution.&nbsp;This idea didn’t sit well with 10up’er Jonathan Neal,&nbsp;tasked with engineering a beautiful layout for a Fortune 50 forced to contend with supporting older versions. We decided to subsidize his time to see if we could&nbsp;introduce Flexbox support under&nbsp;less-than-ideal browser requirements. The result was Flexibility: a smooth front end experience for older browsers, without compromising our ability to use pioneering layout technology.</p>

</p>
<p>With 2015 coming to a close, I’ve been reflecting on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/">ElasticPress</a> project’s accomplishments since its inception one and a half years ago.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>we <a href="https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/releases/tag/1.7">released&nbsp;ElasticPress 1.7</a></strong>, which completely restructures post meta storage. This&nbsp;enables&nbsp;performant post meta queries with complex comparisons against data <em>types</em>, such as integers, dates, and times. We also fixed some&nbsp;bugs.</p>
<p>Like many of our popular open source projects,&nbsp;ElasticPress was originally conceived as an <em>internal</em> tool designed to support some specific client needs. Since open sourcing the project, ElasticPress has garnered over <strong>30 contributors</strong> (most of whom do not work at 10up), <strong>16 major releases</strong>, and a <strong>thriving Github community</strong>&nbsp;where developers and site owners are collaborating. ElasticPress is used by major hosting companies and across&nbsp;hundreds of websites, some of which serve millions of pages each&nbsp;month. I have introduced developers to ElasticPress at speaking engagements&nbsp;around the world.</p>

<p>We’ve also learned our fair share of lessons&nbsp;since initiating&nbsp;the&nbsp;project. Here are a few that stand out.<br>

<p>I find myself often telling designers and front-end engineers that “buttons should feel like buttons and links should look like links.” It occurs to me, that after a few years of the flat design trend, I should explain what that means.</p>
<h2>Buttons should feel like buttons</h2>
<p>When you press a physical button in the real world — any key on a physical keyboard, for example — you can tactically feel it depressing. You’ll also see its form shrink away from you and the way the light falls on it will cause it to look slightly different.<br>

<p>In 2006, the first <a href="https://sf.wordcamp.org/2006/" target="_blank">WordCamp</a> was held in San Francisco–followed by subsequent camps in cities around the country. This weekend, the first <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a> will take place: an expansion of the traditional San Francisco conference, now attracting the WordPress community on an even larger scale.</p>
<p>Our team regularly contributes to open source projects and community initiatives, and I am thrilled to be one of seven co-organizers of the inaugural WordCamp US. Hosted in Philadelphia, PA on December 4-6, the conference is a jam packed 3-day event: kicking off with a yoga session right after registration, and moving through the weekend with more than 80 speakers and sessions, including 15-minute “Lightning Talks.” Matt Mullenweg will also present the annual “State of the Word” address: a summary on the current and future outlook of the WordPress project and community. The conference will conclude with Contributor Day: an event for novice and seasoned contributors to give back to the WordPress project, co-organized by colleague and Web Engineer, Drew Jaynes.</p>

<p>Our distributed workforce model empowers 10uppers to work where they love, providing us with the freedom to create from inspiring places and spaces around the world.</p>
<p>Take Whitney Yadrich, a Senior Project Manager &amp; Team Lead over in Shawnee, Kansas where you’ll also find her husband, their two dogs (Lita and Sarge), and the town she fell in love with. Whitney was recently featured in the Fall/Winter issue of <a href="http://issuu.com/sunflower_publishing/docs/sm15fawi_singles">Shawnee’s local magazine</a>, where she and two other young professionals dish on their love for their hometown. &nbsp;Supported by our remote work culture, she credits the city for offering inspiring work spaces where she can&nbsp;change-up her scenery, recharge, and stay focused. Whitney also offers tips for the work-from-home professional, namely: prioritizing a normal work schedule, taking the time to get dressed every morning despite the lack of a mandatory commute, and switching up locations regularly to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>Rumors&nbsp;of a <a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Sacramento</a> started in 2012, after&nbsp;I rebooted the WordPress Sacramento Meetup. Fast forward to&nbsp;2015:&nbsp;there are 4 meetup organizers and northern California’s&nbsp;WordCamp San Francisco has been&nbsp;displaced by <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a>.&nbsp;The Art Institute of Sacramento volunteered its&nbsp;campus for an event,&nbsp;a professor offered&nbsp;himself as lead organizer, and indispensable local leaders&nbsp;stepped up&nbsp;to take an active role.</p>
<p>I’m proud to have played <a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/wordcamp-sacramento-jake-goldman/">a small role in co-organizing</a> the first WordCamp Sacramento,&nbsp;which takes place tomorrow, and even more proud&nbsp;that <a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/sponsors/">10up is sponsoring the event</a>. I’ll be joined at the event by three 10uppers who are speaking: Sacramento’s own Ben Ilfeld, who will be <a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/ben-ilfeld/">teaching site advertising basics</a>, Northern California’s Vasken Hauri, who promises to&nbsp;<a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/vasken-hauri/">improve lives with event-driven caching</a>, and Luke Woodward, joining us from out-of-state&nbsp;to&nbsp;debut <a href="https://sacramento.wordcamp.org/2015/luke-woodward/">“Robots Write the Docs.”</a></p>

<p>10up is thrilled to sponsor <a href="https://nyc.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp NYC 2015</a> this weekend in Brooklyn. This year, Chief Executive Officer John Eckman and I are presenting, with Director of Platform Experience Helen Hou-Sandi in attendance.</p>
<p>In “Modernizing WordPress Search with Elasticsearch”, I’ll cover the benefits of Elasticsearch and teach attendees how to use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/">ElasticPress</a>: a 10up plugin that integrates WordPress with Elasticsearch, and significantly improves search results, relevancy, ranking, and filtering within WordPress.</p>
<p>John’s presentation, “The Enterprise Disconnect: WordPress and the Complexity of Simplicity”, will cover the challenges of advocating for WordPress in the enterprise, and different perspectives inside and outside the WordPress community. John will propose approaches that preserve the simplicity of WordPress, while better exposing enterprises to powerful solutions which can be built atop the platform.</p>

<p>This year, Lead Web Engineer Eric Mann and I are attending and speaking at <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a>, the largest global gathering of the PHP community, on October 19-22, 2015 in Las Vegas. ZendCon brings together industry thought leaders, recognized PHP experts, enterprise PHP adopters, as well as independent developers for four days of professional development and networking.</p>
<p>On October 19, Eric will present his first talk, “Sandboxing your Development Environment with Vagrant”, which covers best practices in developer-side virtualization and some of the options available for runtime system configuration. On Wednesday, he’s talking about WordPress and unit testing in “A Tale of Two Test Suites.” Eric will cover fundamentals like API mocking, and comparing and contrasting the&nbsp;standard WordPress integration test suite with mock-powered unit testing alternatives.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, I’ll &nbsp;present “Best Practices for WordPress Enterprise”. I’ll explain how 10up successfully builds highly efficient and scalable WordPress websites for some of the world’s largest companies and organizations. Although I’m&nbsp;focusing on engineering, I’ll also touch on team&nbsp;coordination and workflows.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s easy to take open-source software for granted, and to forget that the Internet we use every day depends in part on the freely donated work of thousands of programmers. If open-source software is at the heart of the Internet, then we might need to examine it from time to time to make sure it’s not bleeding.</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-internets-telltale-heartbleed">The Internet’s Telltale Heartbleed (The New Yorker)</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m proud to be a part of 10up because we are eager to support a platform we use heavily and that powers a significant percentage of the web. <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/giving-back-to-wordpress/">I am sponsored full-time</a> as one of the six lead developers of WordPress, and am very excited to&nbsp;announce further&nbsp;expansion of our support for WordPress. As a fellow committer for WordPress, <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-drew-jaynes">Drew Jaynes</a> will now also be enabled to work full-time on WordPress. Drew has been instrumental in creating awareness, standards, and output in our developer documentation, as well as contributing in many other areas in the core software and in community projects such as the WordPress.org site itself.</p>
<p>As a part of this expansion, we’ve created a&nbsp;Platform Engineer position and transitioned Drew to his new title. While we’re not currently hiring for the position, we’ve intentionally left the title open-ended as we continue to grow our support for and even build web platforms. We’ve dedicated significant resources to WordPress as well as projects like <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2015/sponsoring-sanitize-css/">sanitize.css</a> and <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">VVV</a>, and envision a future in which we continue to do the same elsewhere.</p>
<p>10up also has the rare opportunity to take advantage of a confluence&nbsp;of timing, a core WordPress&nbsp;initiative, and an employee who already runs the effort. We are doing this by donating 100 hours of <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-scott-clark">Scott Kingsley Clark’s</a> company time to the ongoing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/">Fields API project</a>, starting today. Scott has already assembled a strong group of contributors and laid a solid foundation and roadmap, and we feel strongly that supporting this initiative will help move it into a viable state for potential inclusion in a near-future release of WordPress. As a company with a central mission of creating great publishing experiences, the user and developer experiences a fields API can improve are something we are particularly well-versed in.</p>

<p>On September 16, Apple launched iOS 9 with a suite of enhancements. One buried feature has the web content industry talking: content blocking. The immediate and obvious use case being blocking of ads and third-party scripts often used for site metrics. Less than one week in, a $0.99 ad blocker is atop the iOS App Store’s paid app charts, and a $3.99 ad blocker trails right behind it.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the ethical implications and hypothetical impact. Clients who look to 10up for web and online revenue strategies were, naturally, less interested in debating whether content blocking is fair, and more interested in modeling their potential impact and adapting. While we couldn’t help touching on the ethics – an open web is core to 10up’s DNA – we focused on analyzing technical realities, data informed predictions, practical industry implications, and potential strategies publishers can apply&nbsp;to face&nbsp;a changing landscape.</p>

<p>A newly hired UX Designer once quipped, “I could spend all day obsessing about word choices.” It’s true, we could! Those small fragments of text—a phrase, a sentence fragment, or even a word—can make an interface really work. We call it microcopy.</p>
<p>Microcopy sits unobtrusively alongside user interface, ready to provide contextual information for a user that needs that extra bit of help or information. It makes visitors feel confident and can help reinforce a client’s brand through tone and style. Typically you see microcopy near interactive elements. Here are some prototypical examples of microcopy found online:</p>

<style type="text/css">

The plugin features the functionality that media publishers value most, such as easy video uploads and playlist management. We even designed the plugin with extensibility in mind, so that major media companies with unique workflows and presentation requirements can customize and extend their experience.</p>

<p>I’m very excited this week for&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.designcontentconf.com/">Design and Content Conference</a> in Vancouver BC. The conference theme is “Designers and Content Strategists: We’re Better Together,” and the speakers list is a who’s-who of the web design and content strategy worlds, including Ethan Marcotte and Karen McGrane, whose <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/content-strategy-for-mobile"><i>Content Strategy for Mobile</i></a> was the first detailed, extended discussion of how design and content come together in a multi-device world.</p>
<p>For me, the most important shifts in the web design and development industry in the last decade have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recognition of content strategy as a discipline, and the inclusion of content strategy-driven thinking in web teams. (See Kristina Halvorson’s <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy"><i>The Discipline of Content Strategy</i></a> and <a href="http://contentstrategy.com/"><i>Content Strategy for the Web</i></a>)</li>
<li>The acknowledgement of the impact responsive web design has on the design process, activities, and outputs (See Marcotte’s <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design"><i>Responsive Web Design</i></a> and <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design"><i>Responsive Web Design</i></a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>As these authors &nbsp;pointed out, neither concept was entirely new. Ethan’s article referenced “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao">A Dao of Web Design</a>” which prescribed “pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use.”</p>

<p><a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Europe</a> is this weekend, and four 10uppers have made the trek to Seville, Spain to mingle and&nbsp;share insights.</p>
<p>I will be presenting on Friday on the <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/session/getting-wordpress-out-of-its-own-way-a-nux-case-study/">experience of setting up WordPress for new users</a>, raising questions about how WordPress&nbsp;can continue to drive adoption by catering to that audience. I’ll also be teaching attendees&nbsp;how to write documentation for the handbooks, inline docs, and examples for the code reference.</p>
<p>Director of Platform Helen Hou-Sandi is presenting&nbsp;<a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/session/developing-for-capabilities/">Developing for Capabilities</a>, covering approaches for mobile, responsive, and accessible development. Lead Engineer Eric Mann will be giving a short talk on Saturday on how to <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/session/short-talks-4/">sandbox a development environment with Vagrant</a>. Finally, Senior Engineer Adam Silverstein will talk about Backbone.js and WordPress, in <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/session/backbone/">Putting a little Backbone in your WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>With a packed <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/">schedule</a>&nbsp;and huge attendance, WordCamp Europe looks to live up to its name once again as the premier WordCamp abroad.</p>

<p>10up is widely known for the complex and unique web experiences we produce. We consistently create unparalleled experiences for our clients and while engineering and design is a large part of that, senior project and account management talent are critical to the success of 10up and its clients.</p>
<p>In an effort to thank you for helping us find our next 10upper, we’ll offer you a finders fee of $500 if we decide to hire who you referred. We’ll even go a step further and throw in an additional $500 when they complete a successful 6 month review just to show our appreciation.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://10up.com/about/">talented team of strategists</a> consulting with enterprise clients, leading our engineers and designers, coordinating site launches, and resourcing/planning/managing some pretty <a href="https://10up.com/our-work/techcrunch/">exciting projects</a> – and better yet, we are looking to expand the team!</p>

<p>Once again, 10up is&nbsp;back for <a href="https://philly.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Philly</a>! This year, co-organizer and 10upper extraordinaire Doug Stewart will be joined by John Eckman, Allen Moore, and myself as speakers.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, I’ll be presenting “<a href="https://philly.wordcamp.org/2015/session/user-first-approaches-to-apis-2/" target="_blank">User-First Approaches to APIs</a>“, which will touch on what we mean by users, what it means to be a maintainer, and the excitement of a potential fields API in WordPress.</p>
<p>Right after that,&nbsp;Allen will be presenting “<a href="https://philly.wordcamp.org/2015/session/a-need-for-speed-performance-driven-front-end-development/" target="_blank">A Need For Speed: Performance Driven Front End Development</a>,” focused on how front end performance affects User Engagement and Experience; best practices for performance driven front end development; and tools to measure front end performance.</p>
<p>Then &nbsp;John will take us into lunch with “<a href="https://philly.wordcamp.org/2015/session/getting-outside-the-wordpress-bubble/" target="_blank">Getting outside the WordPress bubble</a>“, a topic perfect for&nbsp;somebody with deep experiences with other CMS’s and their communities (including commits to Drupal 8!), as well as other communities at large.</p>
<p>WordCamp Philly holds a special place in 10up history, as the place where <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2011/jake-helen-take-wordcamp-philly-2011/">I first met Jake in 2011</a> and began my time as an <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/giving-back-to-wordpress/">agency-backed core contributor to WordPress</a>. Doug even found this photo from that 2011 contributor day in the&nbsp;archives! We’re really excited about all of the great talks scheduled for Saturday, and what’s sure to be another fantastic contributor day on Sunday.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/">evidence</a>&nbsp;to indicate that sliders (or rotators or carousels) are generally ineffective.&nbsp;Engagement with the second slide is precipitously low and engagement with the third slide is near negligible.&nbsp;Assuming visitors see it at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>As an adaptation to information overload, web users have trained themselves to divert their attention away from areas that seem unimportant or look like advertising.<br>
<cite>—Hoa Loranger, NNGroup</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Although Loranger was summarizing a study about right-rail blindness, NNGroup has done previous <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/">examinations of sliders</a> and found a similar effect. <a href="http://erikrunyon.com/2013/01/carousel-stats/">Notre Dame university also studied sliders</a> on their home page and found only 1% of visitors interacted with it at all.</p>
<p>Finally, these interfaces often have usability concerns: microscopic control buttons, odd mobile/touch behavior, and the removal of visitors’ control.</p>

<p>We’re proud to announce the&nbsp;release of&nbsp;<a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/markup">Markup</a>, <a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/css">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/structure">Project Structure</a> sections for&nbsp;our <a href="https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/">Engineering Best Practices</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>&nbsp;and Markup, our industry offers a&nbsp;vast landscape of choices and philosophies, illustrated by the number of&nbsp;frameworks&nbsp;and&nbsp;preprocessors&nbsp;available. While our Front End Engineering team always&nbsp;pushes the boundaries of these platforms, our Best Practices set a&nbsp;standard&nbsp;bar for the techniques, functionality, tools, and libraries we use.</p>
<p>As we focus on practical business application of technology, our philosophies are guided by a mandate to ensure&nbsp;consistent, reliable, and predictable experiences for website visitors. Many CSS attributes and HTML5 features are amazing, but are also&nbsp;dependent on&nbsp;unreliable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a> for compatibility&nbsp;with some&nbsp;popular web browsers. In addition to avoiding known technical pitfalls, standardizing&nbsp;our tools, style, and&nbsp;structure improves efficiency, collaboration, and overall quality of work.</p>
<p>Consistent with our <a href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">support for an open web</a>, our Engineering Best Practices are open and <a href="https://github.com/10up/Engineering-Best-Practices">available on Github</a>. We encourage any and all contributions!</p>

It begins Monday&nbsp;afternoon with an optional tour of the <a href="http://www.celestialseasonings.com/tours">Celestial Tea Factory</a> and a mouth-watering prefixed dinner catering to&nbsp;myriad&nbsp;10up diets. Our summit ends on Thursday&nbsp;night, with most 10uppers&nbsp;traveling home on Friday.</p>

<p>I’m very much looking forward to my first WordCamp in the twin cities, which has a special meaning for me since&nbsp;the&nbsp;venue is less than 10 miles from where I lived through all &nbsp;of middle school, junior high, and high school.</p>
<p>The <a title="WordCamp Minneapolis Schedule" href="http://minneapolis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> is impressive: a full day of four tracks on Saturday plus two tracks on Sunday, plus an after party Saturday night and brunch on Sunday.</p>
<p>If you’re attending, and are interested in learning more about 10up or working with us (as an employee, partner, or client)&nbsp;I’d be happy to chat with you.</p>

I’ll be speaking on Saturday on <a href="http://london.wordcamp.org/2015/session/a-user-first-approach-to-metadata/">what it means to apply a user-first approach to&nbsp;metadata and fields</a>, a topic that is near and dear to anyone who’s extended the WordPress admin, as well as on a core developer Q&amp;A panel on Sunday.</p>
<p>The entire schedule looks great, in addition to Friday’s Contributor Day. We’re especially looking forward to seeing:</p>

WordPress’s releases come a few times a year and involve hundreds of people and thousands of lines of code. A release lead coordinates all of these contributors and contributions, while also managing schedules, priorities, and announcements.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a committer for the past year (with&nbsp;direct access to change the&nbsp;source code)&nbsp;and a driving force behind WordPress&nbsp;documentation, Drew has proven that he’s well-suited to the task, and we’re looking forward to&nbsp;this&nbsp;next release.</p>
<p>As a part of our commitment to the WordPress and open source community, roughly half of Drew’s time is donated to working on core and community initiatives. Building on my own experience as the WordPress 4.0 release lead and fellow committer, I’ll also be close at hand as a ready and willing mentor. We were really excited to be the first agency to sponsor a release lead, and we’re even more excited to do it&nbsp;again so soon. Please join us in congratulating Drew!</p>

<p>ElasticPress is coming to Paris this weekend. I will be speaking at WordCamp Paris on January 23, 2015. Day one of the camp is being held at MAS Paris, and day two is at the EEMI school.</p>
<p>My session, occuring Friday at 3pm, is titled “Modernizing WordPress Search with Elasticsearch”. I will describe the limitations of WordPress search and present an alternative, Elasticsearch and ElasticPress. I will explain some basic Elasticsearch cluster configuration tips, run through ElasticPress setup, and demonstrate some really interesting queries that can be achieved with the plugin.</p>
<p>Whether you are a novice WordPress developer or an expert systems engineer with Elasticsearch experience, my session will demonstrate the power of WordPress and ElasticPress and hopefully spark some ideas on how you can improve your site’s search experience.</p>
<p>If you are attending WordCamp Paris, please come say hello! 10up is hiring, and I am always happy to chat about opportunities.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<a href="http://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>&nbsp;came to us&nbsp;to help engineer <em><strong>Gif the Halls</strong></em> –&nbsp;part digital&nbsp;holiday greeting, part&nbsp;holiday art exhibition – we were more than a little intrigued.</p>
<p>The WP Engine Labs team&nbsp;commissioned six digital artists to create holiday themed animations, to be projected onto buildings in San Francisco – and they&nbsp;needed a way to collect holiday messages from the masses. Enabling visitors, directed from the exhibit, to&nbsp;build digital holiday cards on the (WP Engine hosted) website was the <em>easy</em> part.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14127" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357.png" alt="Gif the Halls" width="914" height="693" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357.png 914w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357-300x227.png 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357-768x582.png 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357-756x573.png 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357-164x124.png 164w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/12/screencapture-gifthehalls-com1-e1418348050357-119x90.png 119w" sizes="(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>First, we had to build an output system to&nbsp;project&nbsp;cards onto the buildings in San Francisco, and that output system needed a queue manager, so that&nbsp;only approved&nbsp;cards would appear. Still&nbsp;doesn’t sound too hard?</p>
<p><strong><em>We also had to engineer remote controlled video capture.</em></strong>&nbsp;Collecting and displaying cards wasn’t enough: we&nbsp;wanted to capture reactions to the&nbsp;exhibit right on the street. Our set-up would determine when a&nbsp;camera should&nbsp;record, transcode that video&nbsp;recording, and share the reaction with the&nbsp;original card creator,&nbsp;who would in turn share the video with friends and family. Without getting too technical,&nbsp;we created a bridge between WordPress and a digital SLR so that when cards are&nbsp;presented, the camera in San Francisco begins&nbsp;recording.</p>

<p>On December 16-17, the third annual BackboneConf will take place in Cambridge, MA. <a title="BackboneConf" href="http://backboneconf.com/">BackboneConf</a> is conference about building real-time applications for the web, with a focus on the Backbone.js library.</p>
<p>I will be giving a talk on the WordPress JSON REST API. I have been actively involved in the REST API project over the past year, and I am excited to share our efforts with a new community. In my presentation I cover some of the challenges building an API for 23% of the web brings, and what the project means to the future of WordPress.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved with the WordPress JSON REST API proejct or working for 10up pull me aside.</p>

From <a title="Safari Push Notifications" href="https://pushupnotifications.com/">push notifications</a> and <a title="Meet ElasticPress" href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/meet-elasticpress/">search</a> to <a title="Varying Vagrant Vagrants" href="https://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">standardizing local development</a>, we’re most proud of contributions that advance markets and platforms, not just 10up.</p>
<p>Months ago, <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>, a market leader in managed WordPress hosting, reached out to us for candid feedback with an eye toward&nbsp;the platform’s future. The <a title="WP Engine Labs" href="http://wpengine.com/labs">Labs</a> team was determined to invent not only the future of WP Engine, but the future of WordPress hosting; to be as disruptive as WP Engine was in its earliest days. From better hardware and developer tools to bleeding edge performance technology, the vision was compelling, and it was clear that from CEO Heather Bruner to Founder &amp; CTO Jason Cohen, they were all in.</p>
<p>Its 10up’s position that a rich, forward-looking ecosystem of managed hosting choices is <strong><em>vital</em></strong> to the success of a web platform; we’re only as strong as the weakest part of our stack. Membership, integrated social engagement – even e-commerce – are increasingly entangled with content and publishing, and there are, unsurprisingly, a dearth of hosted WordPress choices tackling these use cases. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Failwhale.png">fail-whale</a> oft-reminded us, these cases are very hard to scale, particularly with run-time languages like PHP atop traditional SQL databases. Just ask Facebook. (Actually: we did. Read on.)</p>
<p>WP Engine wanted to tackle this problem. They had us at “do you want to help us build it?”</p>

<p>At 10up, we build custom publishing experiences. We take great pride in all aspects of building websites, from user interaction design&nbsp;to code performance. Security, style, workflow, design patterns, performance, and even tools all influence that publishing experience. We use the term “engineer” rather than “develop” because of the amount of skillful strategy and true craftsmanship involved in what we build.</p>
<p>With over 90 full time employees, 10up has a diverse team of strategists, project managers, designers, and a few dozen incredibly smart, diverse engineers. Standardization in engineering is increasingly important with such a large team. Over the past few months we collaborated as a company to document how we engineer and why. We spent a great deal of time considering various things such as WP_Query performance recommendations, workflows to maximize efficiency, and tools we want to use and maintain as a team.</p>
<p><strong>We are proud to open source&nbsp;our <a href="http://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/">Engineering Best Practices</a> as a <a href="https://github.com/10up/Engineering-Best-Practices">public project on GitHub</a></strong>. WordPress is an open-source project and so are our Engineering Best Practices. We believe WordPress has continued to grow because of its embracement of open source philosophies. We want&nbsp;our Best Practices to follow that model. We know there are opportunities to keep improving,&nbsp;and want to <strong>welcome&nbsp;community contributions that are in tune with our philosophies</strong>.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce the release of a new plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/">ElasticPress</a>, to the WordPress&nbsp;community. The project&nbsp;started as an internal initiative to meet a particularly common yet difficult client request: improved WordPress search.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-13551 size-full" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/icon-256x256.jpg" alt="ElasticPress" width="216" height="216" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2014/10/icon-256x256.jpg 216w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/10/icon-256x256-150x150.jpg 150w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/10/icon-256x256-124x124.jpg 124w, https://10up.com/uploads/2014/10/icon-256x256-90x90.jpg 90w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></p>
<p>ElasticPress integrates WordPress search with Elasticsearch which has become increasingly prominent powering search on major enterprise websites such as Github and WordPress.com. Elasticsearch is a scalable, peformant, and open source standalone search server based on a technology from Apache called Lucene.&nbsp;Besides being fast and scalable, Elasticsearch can do things like relevant results, autosuggest, geographic search, fuzzy matching, data weighting, and more.</p>
<p>ElasticPress ties your Elasticsearch instance to WordPress. It is a lightweight plugin that&nbsp;overrides the <code>WP_Query</code> object to return posts from Elasticsearch instead of MySQL. There are a number of <a href="https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress#supported-wp_query-parameters">special WP_Query parameters</a> that the plugin supports to do things like meta, taxonomy, and author searches. ElasticPress can also handle cross-blog search on WordPress multi-site installations.</p>
<p>Full documentation and usage instructions for the plugin are on <a href="https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress">Github</a>. ElasticPress requires WP-CLI as it is preferable to handle things like bulk indexing through PHP CLI.</p>
<p>Please reach out on Github with any questions. We are happy to help and greatly appreciate contributions.</p>

<p><a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San&nbsp;Fransisco</a> was the first WordPress conference, has historically remained the largest (certainly on the North American continent), and is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;WordPress co-founder and project lead Matt Mullenweg’s annual&nbsp;State of the Word address.</p>
<p>In 2012, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2012/wordcamp-san-francisco-10up-annual-meeting-2012/">we brought the “whole team” out</a> (all 14 of us), and watched with delight as our own Helen Hou-Sandi was called out&nbsp;in the&nbsp;State of the Word as a rockstar. In 2013, we decided that taking a team of ~35 was neither logistically practical nor a great way for us to focus on team building, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/10up-wordcamp-san-francisco/">so we brought a contingent of 8</a>, and&nbsp;were proud to showcase four speakers&nbsp;and see &nbsp;Drew Jaynes called out as a&nbsp;rockstar.</p>

<p>WordCamp San Francisco 2014 is this weekend, and this time you’ll find a dozen (12) 10uppers roaming the conference.&nbsp;<strong>This year we’re proud to have 5 speakers participating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Saturday,&nbsp;<a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/session/code-is-poetry-a-musicians-tale/">Helen Hou-Sandi</a> connects her&nbsp;training as professional musician with her career&nbsp;as a code poet.</li>
<li>Kicking off Sunday, <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/session/how-wordpress-saves-lives-moves-governments/">Paul Clark</a> inspires us by reminding how&nbsp;web publishing and WordPress can save lives and move governments.</li>
<li>The three <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/session/lightning-talks-wordpress-in-context/">“WordPress in Context” lightning talks</a>&nbsp;on Saturday feature 2 10uppers – and one 10up alumnus! 10up&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;John Eckman and Senior Engineer Rachel Baker are joined by former&nbsp;Engineering Director (now a leader in the university system) Jeremy Felt.</li>
<li>Finally, our&nbsp;Creative Director, Taylor Aldridge, joins a set of Saturday <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/session/lightning-talks-design-business/">lightning talks on Design &amp; Business</a>.</li>

From health and wildlife outreach programs to community food coalitions, participating non-profits submit technology projects that require assistance they don’t have funding or expertise to carry out. Volunteers will gather on Friday to learn&nbsp;about each Organizations’s Project, form teams, and spend the rest of the weekend (often working through the night) hacking together solutions.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I will be returning for a 3rd year to lead a workshop for participating organizations and volunteers on how to better leverage WordPress on their projects during the weekend and beyond. Many of the participating organizations are either already using WordPress, or have identified their project as requiring a WordPress component. In my session I will cover a variety of WordPress topics ranging from how to start using WordPress for the first time, to using some it’s more advanced APIs, to simple every day tips and tricks. The session will be Saturday morning at 10:30am and is open to the general public.</p>

Best of luck to all the project teams this weekend, and if you’re in the Seattle area I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>I’m proud to be joining my fellow 10uppers for not one, but <em>two</em> WordPress-focused conferences in Dallas, Texas this weekend!</p>
<p><a href="http://podscamp.org/speakers/#wcorg-speaker-scott-kingsley-clark">Scott Kingsley Clark</a>, Lead Developer of the <a href="http://pods.io/" target="_blank">Pods Framework for WordPress</a>, will kick things off with several&nbsp;talks <a href="http://podscamp.org/schedule/" target="_blank">on Friday</a>&nbsp;at PodsCamp, which focuses on the flexibility and varying use cases for the Pods plugin.</p>
<p>If Scott doesn’t collapse from exhaustion after giving four talks, he’ll join Corey Ellis, Jon Bellah, and myself at WordCamp Dallas the next day. Come say hello between sessions, or join us at one of our talks listed below!</p>

The excitement continues around the <a title="WP API Documentation" href="http://wp-api.org/" target="_blank">JSON REST API</a> slated for core integration in the near feature. (I participated on the WP API team, along with fellow 10up’er Rachel Baker). A huge amount of work has gone into the API, and we are all super excited to present on it at WordCamps around the world.</p>
<p>I’ll be giving a <a title="JSON REST API" href="http://2014.providence.wordcamp.org/session/json-rest-api/" target="_blank">talk</a> covering&nbsp;the need for the API, cover REST basics, and teach developers to use the API. Having been the lead contributor to the Backbone client, I will be talking about how developers can use JavaScript to interact with the API.&nbsp;There are already some awesome JavaScript implementations of the API popping up such as my own <a title="_s_backbone" href="https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone" target="_blank">_s_backbone</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in talking about the API, working for 10up, or just generally chatting feel free to pull me aside!</p>

I am very excited to be presenting on enhancing WordPress development by getting curious about core; inspired by the&nbsp;10up experience of&nbsp;building <em>with</em> WordPress and building WordPress <em>itself</em>. I’m also excited&nbsp;to meet a large group of end users, developers, and contributors who&nbsp;many of us based in the United States&nbsp;have few opportunities to see in person, and look forward to&nbsp;collaborating with them&nbsp;at Monday’s Contributor Day.</p>

In light of the upcoming integration of the WP JSON API into WordPress Core, my presentation will focus on building high-quality, performant front-end code that can be safely distributed in the WordPress.org repo.</p>
<p>As WordPress grows beyond a publishing platform to become a powerful and highly extensible CMS with its own JSON API, the need to write clean, readable, and efficient JavaScript is becoming increasingly critical. My&nbsp;talk will cover some common pitfalls that can occur in JavaScript engineering, including overuse of DOM elements, improper variable scoping, and lack of closures within script files. In particular, I’ll explore current best practices in PHP WordPress engineering, with an eye towards applying those same lessons and standards to JavaScript.</p>
<p>Heckling me from the crowd will be various members of an entire 10up pod, visiting Salt Lake City&nbsp;as part of their annual pod retreat.&nbsp;10uppers in attendance include Kailey Lampert, Rachel Backer, Cameron Benedict, Faison Zutavern, Erin Crutcher, Darin Kotter, John Bloch, Cole Geissenger, and Grant Landram.</p>
<p>If you’re a WordPress engineer looking to find out about the latest and greatest that the upcoming JSON API has to offer, as well as how you can create plugins that use the API effectively while still playing nicely with other plugins, this talk is for you.</p>

<p>This weekend, Boston will hold its&nbsp;fifth WordCamp, and 10up will be there to help celebrate the <a title="WordCamp Boston" href="http://2014.boston.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">#BestWordCampEver</a>.</p>
<p>Jake and I will be part of a panel on “<a title="What Boston Gave WordPress, What WordPress Gave Boston" href="http://2014.boston.wordcamp.org/session/what-boston-gave-wordpress-and-what-wordpress-gave-boston/" target="_blank">What Boston&nbsp;Gave WordPress, and What&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;Gave Boston</a>,” which will include the story of the first WordCamp Boston, which we helped plan back in late 2009 / early 2010. In many ways that first WordCamp Boston set in motion a series of events that would result in his founding of 10up and my joining as CEO. It’s really exciting to see the impact the camp (and the meetup) have had on the WordPress community in Boston and across New England.</p>
<p>Taylor Lovett, our Director of Web Engineering, will also be giving a talk about the <a title="JSON REST API" href="http://2014.boston.wordcamp.org/session/the-new-json-rest-api/" target="_blank">JSON REST API</a> targeted for&nbsp;WordPress core in 4.1.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll be joined at the 10up sponsor table and throughout the weekend by 10uppers Dave Ross, Sara Tirrell, and Helen Hou-Sandí. Stop by and say hello!</p>

<p>They say good things happen in threes, and the next week of meetups in NYC are no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/events/200298642/">WordPress NYC Meetup</a> next Tuesday, August 19, I’ll be showing off a preview of the upcoming WordPress 4.0 and talking a bit about what it’s been like to lead the&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>On Thursday the 21st, I will be presenting “Code is Poetry: A Musician’s Tale” at the JerseyScript takeover of <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/">Brooklyn JS</a>, which 10up is excited to sponsor. I’ll be giving a longer version of the talk at <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a> in October, so no spoilers here! Be on the lookout: our Director of Engineering, Taylor Lovett, will be in attendance as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Finally, Brooklyn JS will turn the tides and take over the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jerseyscript/events/200918722/">JerseyScript meetup</a> on Tuesday, August 26, also sponsored by 10up. I’m especially excited to be coming on board as a co-organizer for JerseyScript proper. We’ll be releasing another block of tickets soon, so get on the waitlist now if you’d like to join us and check out Jersey City, just a quick subway ride over from&nbsp;Manhattan.</p>
<p>If I won’t see you here on one of the sides of the rivers, there’s always <a href="http://2014.boston.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Boston</a> the weekend in between. If you will be at any of these places, come say&nbsp;hi!</p>

<p>Tickets are still available – including a harbor cruise with the requisite lobster dinner – so it’s not too late to join us this weekend for some WordPress-centric learning and conversation during the beautiful Maine summer!</p>

<p>WordCamp NYC 2014 is this weekend and we’re excited to take part as speakers, attendees, and sponsor. WordCamp NYC is always a great time, and this one is no different, with four full tracks across two days at the Marriott at Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>When <a title="John Bloch" href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-john-bloch">John Bloch</a> and I (Eric Mann) started working with TechCrunch last year on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/15/techcrunch-has-redesigned-again/">their site redesign</a>, one of the main&nbsp;goals was to improve site performance. Among the various tools we built to help meet that metric was a library called <a title="TechCrunch Open Sources Its WordPress Async Task Library" href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/31/wp-async-task-our-new-open-source-library/">WP Async Task</a>: an abstract library meant to give structure to asynchronous background tasks.</p>
<p>Thanks to WP Async Task, we can offload time-consuming requests (like Twitter interactions) from the main WordPress thread. Editors can publish posts as usual while expensive tasks run in the background rather than holding up the publication process.</p>

<p>In June, the TechCrunch team presented on&nbsp;“<a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/non-blocking-wordpress/">Non-Blocking WordPress</a>,” explaining some of the approaches we took. Attendees were interested in learning more about WP Async Task and particularly interested in whether the code was available anywhere.</p>
<p>Being big believers in the power of open-source and giving back to the community, we’re thrilled to say that TechCrunch has decided to open-source the library and make it <a href="https://github.com/techcrunch/wp-async-task/">available on GitHub</a>. Check out the library and look at the documentation on <a href="https://github.com/techcrunch/wp-async-task#quick-start">how to use the library</a> in your own code.</p>

<p>This weekend 10up will be&nbsp;bringing some&nbsp;sunshine (and ten&nbsp;10uppers!) to the Northwest for the 5th annual&nbsp;WordCamp Seattle. Seattle is a two day WordCamp this year with a jam packed&nbsp;Saturday featuring&nbsp;speakers, panels, lightning talks and even workshops. Sunday is a special <a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/contributor-day-sunday-june-29th/" target="_blank">contributor day</a> with a number of core contributors leading groups&nbsp;who will be contributing back to the WordPress project. If you’re in the Northwest and haven’t already picked up your ticket, don’t&nbsp;miss this massive, 700-attendee WordCamp!</p>
<p>Kicking off the day on Saturday,&nbsp;Kailey Lampert and Adam Silverstein will each be delivering a presentation&nbsp;as a part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/about/sessions/#wcorg-session-807063" target="_blank">developer lightning talks</a>. Their sessions will focus&nbsp;on the hidden treasures&nbsp;of WordPress core and working with WordPress revisions in Backbone. Kailey will be pulling a double feature on Saturday, also being a part of the <a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/about/sessions/#wcorg-session-807141" target="_blank">How to Become a Better WordPress Developer panel</a> with&nbsp;Kronda Adair,&nbsp;Jeremy Felt,&nbsp;Zack Tollman and&nbsp;Morten Rand-Hendriksen.</p>
<p>Next, Paul Clark will be running&nbsp;an excellent session on <a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/case-study-performance-scale-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">Performance, Scale and WordPress</a>, using real world examples from 10up’s experience with sites&nbsp;like Ted.com and hosting platforms like&nbsp;WordPress.com VIP. For anyone considering WordPress and it’s application in&nbsp;an enterprise context, don’t miss Paul’s presentation!</p>
<p>At the same time as Paul, Taylor Dewey will be running <a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/sass-its-more-than-just-variables-in-your-css/" target="_blank">a workshop on SASS</a>, walking through real life examples and breaking down some of the complexities of the workflow. If you’re thinking about getting into SASS, or have started and need a good&nbsp;tutorial, make sure you check out Taylor’s workshop. Taylor is also pulling a double feature, and will be giving a lightning talk on <a href="http://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/about/sessions/#wcorg-session-807118" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design Workflows</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the four 10uppers presenting this weekend Andrew Mowe, Zach Brown, Luke Woodward, Cole Geissinger, Drew Jaynes and myself will all be on-site organizing, volunteering and contributing&nbsp;to the event. We’d love to see you there!</p>

<p>I love working in a global community! WordPress touches every corner of the globe and attracts both writers and developers from just about every country on the planet. Many of them are so enthusiastic they hold annual WordCamps to celebrate the application that ties us together. This weekend, I get to visit one such&nbsp;WordCamp.</p>

It’s going to be a trip to&nbsp;remember.</p>
<p>WordCamp Romania&nbsp;is themed around telling stories, so I’ll be telling a bit of my own history with WordPress as well as encouraging new developers to become even more involved in the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>Sunday is a “leisure day” when I hope to touch base with some other WordPress aficionados to sit down and work on core code (the WordPress 4.0 beta&nbsp;<em>is</em> coming near, we need all hands on&nbsp;deck!).</p>
<p>Above all, though, I’m excited to connect even more with the global WordPress community. WordPress is global, and 10up has a growing global presence. I’m just honored to be a part of&nbsp;both!</p>

We also know that the modern web requires talent&nbsp;that understands that great design is not just how a website looks, but how it feels across input interfaces and screen sizes.&nbsp;As we continue to grow our&nbsp;design team, we’re very excited to welcome a designer that embodies our vision of client-centered&nbsp;design, as innovative in its aesthetics as its interactions.</p>
<p>Louis Dorman has been designing for the web since the days of dial-up. After&nbsp;graduating from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artinstitutes.edu/phoenix/">Art Institute of Phoenix</a> in 2001, he went&nbsp;on to be responsible for the design and manufacturing of millions of products around the world. Louis was one of the first employees at <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a>, one of the most popular WordPress-powered websites. As Art Director, he managed all areas&nbsp;of&nbsp;design,&nbsp;from the web presentation and UX to marketing&nbsp;collateral, as the company scaled to 30 million+ monthly unique visitors.</p>
<p>Louis was also a founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/02/07/adcamo-offers-background-advertising-hmmmm/">AdCamo</a>, which would become&nbsp;a pioneer in the development of background ad units under his direction. In addition to steering&nbsp;vision and project development, Louis&nbsp;hired and mentored creative and engineering&nbsp;teams, managed communication between sales and engineering, and created campaigns for clients like ABC, Comcast, Craftsman, MGM, Sony, and WWE, to name a few.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to debut&nbsp;my first WordCamp keynote this coming weekend at the illustrious <a href="http://2014.philly.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-philly-keynote-speaker-helen-hou-sandi/">WordCamp Philly</a>! I’m&nbsp;presenting&nbsp;a remix of a&nbsp;my WordCamp Connecticut talk,&nbsp;“How I convinced my boss to let me work on WordPress full-time”, arguing&nbsp;for personal and company&nbsp;investment in open source. I’ll look at how and why teams like 10up&nbsp;<a title="Giving Back" href="https://10up.com/giving-back/">donate back to the community</a>, and offer&nbsp;ways that attendees&nbsp;can give back, too.</p>
<p>10uppers will also be quite well represented: Dave Ross will be speaking on “<a href="http://2014.philly.wordcamp.org/session/easier-more-secure-deploys-with-docker-and-dokku/">Easier, More Secure Deploys with Docker and Dokku</a>“, Doug Stewart pulls double duty as co-organizer and <a href="http://2014.philly.wordcamp.org/session/working-from-home/">“working from home”&nbsp;panel</a> moderator, and Cindy Kendrick and Spencer Hansen will be in attendance. Hope to&nbsp;see you there, whether in a session, Sunday’s contributor day, or in the hallways.</p>

</p>
<p>When I first joined 10up, one of my first challenges was building a <a title="Tweet by Category" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-twitter/">Twitter plugin</a> for a client who wanted to automatically tweet based on&nbsp;<em>category</em>.&nbsp;Luckily, I work with an&nbsp;amazing team. I lamented in our team IRC room, and to my surprise,&nbsp;discovered that&nbsp;we already had a plugin that did exactly what I needed. Well, almost exactly.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;existing module,&nbsp;built for another client, was&nbsp;all but abandoned before it was fully polished for non-specific use cases. It also used Twitter’s deprecated v1 API, so I had to swap out the communication layer. Still, I had a starting point thanks to the inventiveness of the team, and our consistent application of coding standards.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, we had a solid, polished release using the v1.1 API ready for a new client. We released the project (it was still not fully abstracted, but complete enough for their purposes) and pushed it to the back burner (read: all but abandoned it again).&nbsp;Last month, yet another client requested the same feature. I dusted off <a href="https://github.com/10up">our Git repository</a> and started smoothing out the still rough edges so we could launch an even more refined&nbsp;version for&nbsp;a third client.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this plugin only exists as a result&nbsp;of the way our&nbsp;team collaborates. It has been gradually improved and iterated&nbsp;over time across&nbsp;multiple developers and disparate project requirements. Yet we had&nbsp;<em>never</em> released the source outside of our company.</p>
<p>A couple of emails and about 10 minutes later, <strong>Publish to Twitter</strong> went&nbsp;public&nbsp;on both <a title="Publish to Twitter" href="https://github.com/10up/publish-to-twitter">GitHub</a> and <a title="Publish to Twitter" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-twitter/">WordPress.org</a>. I’d personally like to invite you to join the growing team of collaborators on this project to help make it even more flexible and useful for our entire&nbsp;community.</p>

<p>Around this time in 2013 we held&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a title="Preparing for Portland: 10up’s Developer Summit" href="https://10up.com/blog/preparing-for-developer-summit/">Developer Summit</a> – an in person gathering of&nbsp;our team focused on skill building. We covered everything from PHP unit testing to JavaScript performance optimization, and even rolled out <a title="Varying Vagrant Vagrants: All Grown Up" href="https://10up.com/blog/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>. From SASS to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ericdelabar.com/2008/05/metaprogramming-javascript.html">duck punching</a>, that summit influences how I write code today, when I still have the occasion&nbsp;to do so.</p>
<p>10up has grown since April 2013, not just in&nbsp;raw&nbsp;numbers (we’ve tripled), but in scope. Add a&nbsp;talented design team and&nbsp;nearly a dozen web strategists and project managers and our&nbsp;second annual “developer” summit already needs a rebranding: let’s call it a&nbsp;<strong>Learning Summit</strong>.</p>

I’m <a href="http://johneckman.com/">John Eckman</a> and I’m truly honored to officially join <a href="https://10up.com/about/">team 10up</a> today as CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Goldman will continue as President &amp; Founder, and we will work closely together, as well as with the strong leadership team already in place,</strong> especially VP’s Jess Jurick and Vasken Hauri, as well as Directors Helen Hou-Sandi, John James Jacoby, Paul Clark, Taylor Aldridge, and Zach Brown. It’s truly an all-star team up and down the roster at 10up, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be part of it.</p>
<p>In broad strokes, Jake will focus on product development, recruiting, partnerships, business development, and company vision, while I will be more focused on operational management, client relationships, talent development, and execution against that vision.</p>
<p>Jake and the team have accomplished much over the last 3+ years, and I hope to continue that tradition of excellence while bringing additional processes and organizational development approaches appropriate to a growing firm.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the past 15+ years working in professional services agencies on digital strategy, user experience design, and software engineering, with a focus on content management, web publishing, and social. Short version: TVisions (which became Molecular, which became Isobar), PixelMEDIA, Optaros, and ISITE Design. (Long version: see <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johneckman">LinkedIn</a>).</p>
<p>Over the course of that career I’ve worked with clients across many industries and sizes, from early-stage startups to the Fortune 50, as well as higher education and the non-profit sector. I’ve had the opportunity to work as a user experience manager, a technical architect, a project manager (and program manager), an account director and a strategy lead. I’ve worn most of the hats one can wear at a digital agency (other than visual designer, a fact that may be reasonably inferred from my own personal sites), and love nothing more than working with a team to solve a client problem or exceed a client expectation.</p>

</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to unveil our second collaboration with ESPN, the new&nbsp;<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>! The site relaunched today with a fresh new Responsive design and content strategy on&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>&nbsp;VIP. Over the course of roughly three months, 10up worked closely with ESPN to implement their new design vision, ensuring a fluid reader experience across devices using creative provided by their team. The WordPress theme powering the site features custom curation interfaces, advanced post editor controls (like footnotes), and sophisticated ad and analytics integrations.</p>
<p>The new FiveThirtyEight will continue to embody data journalism at its core, with Nate Silver at the helm now leading dozens of journalists reporting across verticals like Sports, Politics, and Science. In addition to traditional reporting, the site will also employ data visualization techniques to enable readers to better digest, interact with, and apply data trends to their everyday thinking. FiveThirtyEight will be housed in ESPN’s new Exit 31 content group, ”&nbsp;a creative enterprise&nbsp;that will combine&nbsp;the resources of three&nbsp;existing&nbsp;units – ESPN Films, Grantland and FiveThirtyEight&nbsp;– under one&nbsp;umbrella.”</p>
<p>We’ll have more to say about FiveThirtyEight in the future – for now, <a href="http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2014/03/espn-announces-new-content-unit-exit-31/">check out the new site</a>!</p>

<p>We couldn’t be more proud to announce 10up’s first product, <a title="Push Notifications for WordPress" href="http://pushupnotifications.com/">PushUp</a>. PushUp makes it incredibly easy to deliver your content directly to your readers’ desktops, even when their browser is closed. In version 1.0, we’re starting with support for Safari Push Notifications on Mac OS X Mavericks, the best implementation of desktop notifications.</p>
<p><div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 75.0769%;"><iframe loading="lazy" width="650" height="488" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/HWu4XWEesX4.html" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;"></iframe></div></p>
<p>We couldn’t be more proud to feature launch partners like <a href="http://9to5mac.com/">9to5mac</a> and <a href="http://edelman.com/">Edelman</a>, with committed beta customers like Deadline.com and GigaOM taking PushUp into production in a matter of days. Expect to see more familiar brands rolling out PushUp in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We think on demand notifications from websites – from desktop to mobile – is an important evolution in online publishing. Having to actively check a website or feed reader, or even Twitter, for the content you really care about seems to us as antiquated as manually opening your email client to check for new messages. Our push notifications are 100% white-labeled: we send consumers directly to your content. Nothing stands between your and your relationship with your reader, not even a link in the middle to our services.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Safari Push Notifications is just the beginning.</p>

<p>As an agency with a reputation for building world-class solutions with WordPress, it may surprise you that one of our latest and most exciting projects barely even involves WordPress.</p>
<p>A new Interactive Dashboard experience, built for <a href="http://ew.com/">Entertainment Weekly’s desktop</a> and <a href="http://m.ew.com/">mobile websites</a>, presents real-time content from across EW’s vast network of industry-leading entertainment reporting. The Dashboard enables EW’s team to instantly post and curate relevant content from Twitter, EW’s network of entertainment blogs (powered by WordPress), and exclusive Red Carpet photos, serving up a true second-screen interactive experience for major entertainment events.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Dashboard had its first successful trial run during the Grammys, and will be in full swing during tonight’s Oscars presentation!</strong></em></p>
<p>Whether you’re on your computer, iPad, or mobile phone, we hope you’ll tune in!</p>

The event is sold out and we are excited to share our knowledge with the St. Louis WordPress community and meet fellow WordPress fans.</p>
<p>Our talks are all in the Developer II track, in support of the burgeoning local developer community.</p>
<p>My topic is “Revising WordPress Revisions.” I will cover the story and code behind the Backbone.js based revisions interface introduced in WordPress 3.6 and why revisions are awesome. What goes into remaking a feature in WordPress?</p>
<p>Doug’s topic is “Making Your Whole Life Easier With WP-CLI.” Doug will introduce developers to the powerful wp-cli, the WordPress command line interface. Doug will offer his perspective as a systems engineer, and expose developers to the power of administering WordPress from the command line.</p>
<p>Rachel’s topic is “Code with Care: Write Secure Plugins and Themes.” Rachel will cover how to protect sites from XSS (cross-site scripting), CSRF exploits, and unfiltered input attacks during common WordPress development practices. She will provide the security best-practices “how and why” for securing your code.</p>

<p>Autocomplete is not a new concept in the WordPress admin – tags have had suggestions powered by <a href="http://www.enjoyxstudy.com/javascript/suggest/index.en.html">suggest.js</a> since <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/6542">their introduction six years ago</a> in version 2.5. This, however, remained the only instance of Ajax-powered autocompletion for another four years, until <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19810">adding users in multisite was enhanced</a> with <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/">jQuery UI autocomplete</a> for 3.4. It was originally committed with deliberately unpolished styling, so when I saw <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20584#comment:1">a request to make it look better</a>, I decided to take it on. I may not consider myself a creative designer, but I do have an eye and passion for UI consistency. After a little iteration on both the design and code, we had a fully functional instance of autocomplete.</p>

</p>
<p>10up is a digital agency that hangs its hat on the viability of open source web platforms – WordPress in particular. We think WordPress is the platform of choice for content management and publishing, and we’ve built <a title="team 10up" href="https://10up.com/about/">a team</a> that shares these open values and grasps WordPress like few others. More than 25 of us have made core contributions, and we’re home to&nbsp;<em>two</em> core committers. Needless to say, as President, I spend significant time thinking about this platform, from its underlying code quality to the healthy – and less healthy – habits of its considerable community.</p>
<p>Where is WordPress heading? Where&nbsp;<em>should</em> it head? Where are the biggest opportunities? How can WordPress continue to dominate the CMS space in another 5 years? <a href="http://jakegoldman.me/2013/09/wordpress-app-platform/">Does it make a good app platform?</a> Is there another platform we should be mastering?</p>
<p>So when WP Elevate’s Troy Dean invited me to participate in a live panel on the “future of WordPress” with leaders like WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg, Woo’s Scott Basgaard, and Modern Tribe’s Shane Pearlman (among others), I didn’t hesitate to accept.</p>
<h3><strong>You can catch <a href="http://wpthinktank.com/">WP Think Tank</a> tomorrow (February 25) at 8 pm UTC / 12 pm Pacific / 3 pm Eastern.</strong></h3>
<p>Rumor has it that, based on the reception, this might not be the only episode of WP Think Tank!</p>

<p>Hey there PDX! As you may know, 10up has a brick &amp; mortar office in Portland. So when our friend <a href="http://scottberkun.com/" target="_blank">Scott Berkun</a> reached out to us saying he’d be in Portland next weekend, we thought&nbsp;<em>Why not host a fun, unique opportunity to hear from Scott at the 10up office?</em></p>
<p>It’s our pleasure to announce we’ll be hosting Scott for a small, intimate chat about his recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com/dp/1118660633" target="_blank">The Year Without Pants</a> and his time running a distributed team working on WordPress.com. If you’re a designer, engineer, project manager or other web savvy Portlander interested in WordPress and/or distributed work, we’d love for you to join us!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The event is next Thursday, 2/27 from 5-7pm</strong></span> at the 10up office located at 618 NW Glisan St #400 Portland, OR 97209 with an informal happy hour around the corner at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=PINTS&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=pints+portland&amp;cid=5653254511340114962&amp;ei=d-oEU7ePEMSEyAGimID4DQ&amp;ved=0CKEBEPwSMAo" target="_blank">Pint’s</a> following Scott’s talk.

</p>
<p>After the excitement of the 3.8 release and a typically quiet winter holiday season, it’s time to start in earnest on WordPress 3.9. This is a particularly exciting release for me: after three cycles of being a guest committer, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/">I’ve been granted permanent commit access to core</a>. My goal is to continue to inform and build the admin experience, provide feedback on community contributions, and bring perspectives from real-world client implementation back to our favorite publishing platform. I’m honored to join these trusted ranks!</p>
<p>Drew Jaynes has also been renewed as a guest committer, and is on track to complete the inline documentation for hooks initiative. A few 10uppers have already begun contributing patches, with several working on unit tests. I’m particularly excited to see work by Adam Silverstein on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20564">storing revisions of post meta</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299">a ticket on the topic opened by Jake</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremyfelt.com/code/2013/12/11/vvv-turns-one/">Just a bit over a year ago</a>, then-10upper Jeremy Felt decided it was time to part ways with MAMP and make friendly with Vagrant. With a little help from fellow 10up senior engineers and systems experts, <a href="https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>&nbsp;was born, introducing a consistent and shareable approach to a WordPress development environment that better represented the real world production environments agencies like 10up build for.</p>
<p>With a 1.0 release, almost 800 commits, and nearly 40 contributors, it’s safe to say that Varying Vagrant Vagrants, or VVV as it’s become known, is an active and stable open source project. We’re so proud to have served as its founders and creators, and look forward to continuing to play a major role in its development and maintenance.</p>
<p><em><strong>And now, it’s time to give VVV a community of its own.</strong></em>&nbsp;A new Varying Vagrant Vagrants organization on GitHub has been created, and ownership of the main VVV repository is being transferred there.</p>
<p>It’s a little bittersweet to see your project take on its own life, and this is no different. Yet, as strong advocates for open source and the rising tide it fosters, we’re even more excited to see one of our investments in open R&amp;D take flight, and look forward to contributing to VVV, its community, and its future.</p>

<p><em>We’re kicking off a series about first patches that became a part of an open source software project, beginning with my own story. With 25 of 50 10uppers – at the time of writing – credited as core contributors to WordPress, credits in a number of other projects, and communities of hundreds of contributors at large, we won’t run out of material any time soon. We hope that these sometimes inspiring and often humbling stories, from one-time contributors all the way up to the most prolific WordPress core developers, will entertain and offer some perspective to open source’s newest would-be contributors. Do you remember your first patch? Tell us how to get ahold of you in the comments, and we just might feature you!<br>
</em></p>
<p>My first committed patch to WordPress was for <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17887">#17887</a> in June 2011, just a few months before I joined 10up. I was running trunk in my testing environment to ensure that our live site would upgrade smoothly and to be able to explain the impending 3.2 redesign to our users at the university. In hindsight, my experience is probably typical for first-time contributors, and may surprise those who know me today.</p>

<p>I’ll be speaking about “Who is WordPress?” at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-New-Jersey-WordPress-Meetup-Group/events/160694822/">New Jersey WordPress Meetup</a> down in Asbury Park, NJ next Tuesday, January 28. We’ll take a look at how WordPress is made and grows with the help of an amazing community, and how you’re already a part of it. This is my first time joining this meetup, and I’m really looking forward to&nbsp;it!</p>

I’m heading to <a href="http://2014.norway.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Norway</a> this weekend to talk about my experience learning WordPress security best practices. I’ll be discussing the (many) mistakes I made along the way, how I learned from them, and how you can learn from them,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>This is the third WordCamp Norway to be held in the capital city of Oslo. The first day consists of presentations from speakers from countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Ukraine, Sweden, Switzerland, USA, New Zealand, Spain and Norway. Day two is an optional contributor day for anyone wanting to contribute to WordPress core, documentation, or the WordPress.org support&nbsp;forums.</p>
<p>Anyone in Europe interested in WordPress should come join us at WordCamp Norway. If the past two years’ were anything to go by, the 2014 event will be awesome fun for&nbsp;all.</p>

<p>WordCamp Phoenix holds a special place in my (Paul Clark) heart as a place of many firsts.</p>
<p>In 2012, Taylor Aldridge and I watched 10up’s <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-helen-hou-sandi">Helen Hou-Sandi</a>&nbsp;present on&nbsp;<a href="http://slides.helenhousandi.com/wcphx2012.html#1">Maintaining a Beautiful&nbsp;WordPress Admin UI</a>.

<p>Over the past few years, the <a href="http://brainstormmedia.com/">Brainstorm</a> team was pleasantly surprised each time we encountered 10up. While meeting at conferences around the country, we discovered a deep-set of shared values and goals. 10up and Brainstorm believe that democratized, open publishing platforms like WordPress can make the web — and the world — a better place. We embrace community contribution, and improving the lives of those around us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11282" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1; visibility: visible;" alt="Brainstorm joins 10up" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-756x353.jpg" width="710" height="331" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-756x353.jpg 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-300x140.jpg 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-768x359.jpg 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-220x103.jpg 220w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6-160x75.jpg 160w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/12/BrainUp-Announcement-v6.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" data-xblocker="passed"></p>
<p>As a co-founder of Brainstorm, I (Paul Clark) will be focusing on building new business opportunities, with a special focus on non-profit and cause-oriented engagement. Anyone who has seen my 5-minute talk, “<a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/09/09/paul-clark-lightning-talk-how-wordpress-saves-lives-moves-governments/">How WordPress Saves Lives and Moves Governments</a>,” knows I hold a special place in my heart for big ideas and humanitarian causes.</p>
<p>Taylor Aldridge, Brainstorm’s co-founder, will bring his decades of creative and design experience to 10up’s quickly growing design team, and is eager to see 10up’s creative reputation match its software engineering cred.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Earlier this year we launched a membership component for my very first project with 10up: </span><a style="line-height: 1.7em;" href="http://learningworksforkids.com/">LearningWorks for Kids</a><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">. LearningWorks’s content focuses on making the most of digital content to support learning, academics, and development of critical thinking skills. Memberships come with support for multiple private child users, each of whom has a profile that includes their age, thinking skills, academic skills, and special learning needs. Each member can also indicate which digital platforms and devices are available to their child users.</span></p>
<p>The central benefit of membership, beyond access to exclusive content, is the personalized recommendations across four different content types for each child user. These recommendations take into account the child’s age and available platforms, as well as a combination of skills and needs as indicated in their profile. These are related by <em>five</em> custom taxonomies – platforms, age, thinking skills, academic skills, and special needs. In this instance, we need to get content matching this set of criteria: age <code>AND</code> one of the platforms <code>AND</code> one of thinking skills <code>OR</code> academic skills <code>OR</code> special needs. This is a mixed relationship taxonomy query, and I’ll show you how we pulled it off.</p>

<p>In just a few short hours, three of my favorite 10uppers (myself included) will be participating in the second annual <a href="http://wordsesh.org/">WordSesh</a>&nbsp;— it’s&nbsp;1 full day of live WordPress presentations from all over the world streamed live to your screen.</p>
<p>At 6:00 UTC, our founder, Jake Goldman, is joining&nbsp;prolific free-agent designer James Dalman; together they’ll be presenting “Don’t be the Unicorn” – a talk about finding your specialization within web and WordPress, and effectively collaborating with different specialists!</p>
<p>At 17:00 UTC, one of our always charming and extremely talented senior engineers, Eric Mann, will flex some JS muscle and help pump you up in his session aptly titled: Rock-solid JavaScript and AJAX. Having recently spoke at <a href="https://10up.com/blog/10up-jquery-russia/">jQuery Russia</a>&nbsp;about the <a href="http://eamann.com/slides/jqcon-russia-2013">HTML5 web worker API</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Monkeys</a>, this is a session you will not want to miss.</p>
<p>And me?&nbsp;At 11:00 UTC, I’ll be doing round 2 of last year’s fireside chat, where I’ll naturally be talking about <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a>, <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, 10up, and hopefully taking questions from a lively international audience (since it will be about 5am here in the U.S.). I don’t have unicorns or monkeys, but maybe Paul the Dog will make a special appearance.</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="http://wordsesh.org/#speakers">lineup of speakers</a>&nbsp;is practically an all-star cast of WordPress contributors. If you can’t make our sessions, try to tune in at least for a bit. It starts Saturday, December 7, 2013, at UTC 00:00, and hopefully we’ll see you (or you’ll see us) there!</p>

The topic is “big media editorial experiences”, and I’ll be joined by professionals from the Washington Post, WordPress.com VIP, and Parade.

<p>Here at 10up, we strongly believe that a vibrant and active WordPress community is crucial to our success and longevity. After all, our business is built on the confidence that our favorite piece of free open source software serves as a great publishing platform. As we’ve grown, we’ve been able to expand our commitment to creating amazing publishing experiences for our clients and partners to the WordPress open source project itself.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://10up.com/blog/jake-helen-take-wordcamp-philly-2011/">WordCamp Philly 2011</a>, Jake and I finally met in person for the first time. Over dinner, we talked about our shared values in the community and the conversation led to an intriguing proposition: time each week to spend contributing to WordPress – a donation to the community by way of hours and effort. It began with 5 hours a week, and as 10up grew, it increased to become 8, then 15, then 20 hours each week. Today, I am really excited to announce that <strong>I am officially endorsed to work full-time on WordPress core </strong>as a guest committer and leader in the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>I am officially endorsed to work full-time on WordPress core&nbsp;as a guest committer and leader in the community.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, I have chosen to continue being active on some client projects. We are especially valuable in contributing back to the community in the areas we handle deeply in our work for clients and partners, and I feel that the best way for me to do that is to remain grounded in the world of implementation and especially custom administrative interfaces. I also regard our team as incomparable (<a href="https://10up.com/contact/#jobs-info">for which we’re always hiring</a>) and would hate to miss the opportunity to work with and learn from such an incredible group.</p>

I’ll be opining on the <a href="http://2013.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-interactive-debugging/">joys of interactive debugging</a>, which should be a core part of a developer’s tool set. If your go-to debugging tool starts with var and ends with dump(), this talk is for you! Senior Engineer Carl Danley will be covering <a href="http://2013.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/a-sensible-approach-to-javascript-in-wordpress-plugins/">sensible approaches to JavaScript</a>. In his own words: “<span style="line-height: 1.7em;">More often than not, as WordPress developers, we focus on PHP and often overlook the important aspects of JavaScript. In this presentation, I’ll reveal a series of steps that will help you rock your next JavaScript application by taking it the next level.” On&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Sunday, Carl and I will help lead the <a href="http://2013.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-contribute-session/">Contributor session</a> along with Mark Jaquith, Andrew Nacin and Pippin Williamson – sure to be a good time!</span></p>
<p>WordCamp Orlando is also <a href="http://2013.orlando.wordcamp.org/sponsor/seoslides/">sponsored by&nbsp;<em>seoslides</em></a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://seoslides.com/">WordPress presentation creation and sharing</a> solution built&nbsp;and partly owned by 10up.</p>
<p>Westward in Denver, local Web Engineer Drew Jaynes is leading WordCamp Denver, where he’ll also lead a <a href="http://2013.denver.wordcamp.org/session/contributing-to-wp-going-from-zero-to-patch/">session on WordPress contribution</a>. Senior Strategist Grant Landram is dropping in to take part in a <a href="http://2013.denver.wordcamp.org/session/panel-how-a-ux-focus-is-driving-wordpress-forward/">panel exploring the importance of user experience</a>. Senior Strategic Engineer Luke Woodward continues the quest to <a href="http://2013.denver.wordcamp.org/session/breaking-up-with-amp/">kill classic MAMP / WAMP developer environments</a> in favor of <a href="https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants">the popular Varying Vagrants project</a> seeded by 10up.</p>
<p>Finally, up north in Edmonton, our Vice President of Strategic Engineering, Vasken Hauri, will cover both theory and practical tools for <a href="http://2013.edmonton.wordcamp.org/session/better-living-through-code-scanning/">automating code scanning</a> and maintaining code quality. As a former adjunct Computer Science professor, Vasken is no stranger to tackling complex subjects.</p>

<p>This Saturday I’m hosting a WordPress core hack day here in Jersey City, right outside Manhattan. I’ll be joined by a handful of WordPress developers in the NYC metro area, including lead developers from some of the largest publications, as well as some East Coast 10uppers. Since this particular get-together will be at my home, it’s an intimate group, though I plan to facilitate future hack days at larger venues as we advance our mission to make WordPress a better publishing experience for&nbsp;all.</p>

</p>
<p>This has been a year of firsts, from first releases on <a title="10up Github" href="http://github.com/10up">10up’s GitHub</a> account to our first <a title="Coming to Portland: 10up’s First Internal Developer Summit" href="https://10up.com/blog/10up-2013-developer-summit/">internal dev summit</a>. &nbsp;This year also saw 10up’s first appearance at <a title="jQuery Russia" href="http://jquery.itmozg.ru/">jQuery Russia</a> – coincidentally also the first jQuery conference in Russia!</p>
<p>A little over a week ago, I had the opportunity to visit Moscow for an incredible day of development talks at <a title="Digital October" href="http://digitaloctober.ru/en/">Digital October</a>. &nbsp;The conference was sponsored by <a title="ITmozq" href="http://itmozg.ru/">ITmozg</a> in Russia, and headlined by the president of the <a title="jQuery Foundation" href="https://jquery.org/">jQuery Foundation</a>, Dave Methvin.</p>
<div id="attachment_11124" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11124" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11124 " title="jQuery Cookie" alt="The snacks were as impressive as the talks!" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/IMAG0464-300x169.jpg" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-300x169.jpg 300w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-768x433.jpg 768w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-756x426.jpg 756w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-220x124.jpg 220w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-576x324.jpg 576w, https://10up.com/uploads/2013/10/IMAG0464-160x90.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"><p id="caption-attachment-11124" class="wp-caption-text">The snacks were as impressive as the talks!</p></div>
<p>jQuery Russia covered topics from JavaScript performance to the use of $.Deferred. &nbsp;I was able to present an <a title="Web Workers + jQuery" href="http://eamann.com/slides/jqcon-russia-2013">overview of the HTML5 web worker API</a> along with a live demonstration of the <a title="Infinite Monkey Theorem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">million monkey problem</a> – implemented entirely in JavaScript.</p>
<p>jQuery Russia was an amazing experience for everyone involved, and it showed me just how well different parts of the&nbsp;<em>international</em> development community can work together. &nbsp;I don’t speak Russian and presented my talk with the help of an interpreter. &nbsp;Many of the attendees didn’t speak English, but were able to ask me questions about code after the talk and throughout the conference – again, with the aid of an interpreter.</p>
<p>All of the conference speakers were invited back to the main stage at the end of the day for an interactive Q&amp;A session. Questions ranged from browser standards to what we’d like to see added to JavaScript to where we see jQuery in 5-10 years. The range of opinions was impressive, but the expertise that backed each was even more so.</p>

In 2011, not 6 months after founding 10up, we reached into our pocket to offer a Silver sponsorship, and I spoke about WordPress as a CMS. In 2012, we again extended a Silver sponsorship; I debuted a talk on Enterprise, and was joined by fellow 10up speakers Jess Jurick and Luke Gedeon (who runs the neighboring Providence WordCamp). Today, two 10uppers live in the Boston metro area: Senior Engineer Dave Ross, and Engineer Kelly Dwan, who also organizes the monthly meet up and helped organize this weekend’s event. Three of our senior staff – Jess Jurick, John Jacoby, and I – all lived within ~100 miles of Boston at some point since 10up’s&nbsp;inception.</p>
<p>So it goes without saying that, above and beyond Kelly’s co-organizing, we were going to make a meaningful contribution to WordCamp Boston 2013. With more resources in hand, we’ve provided <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/sponsor/10up/">a top-tier, Platinum Sponsorship</a>; we’re sponsoring Saturday’s lunch! You’ll find 7 of us at the conference, 5 of us&nbsp;speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m giving away 10up <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/session/10-interview-questions-i-ask-every-developer/">developer interview strategies and questions</a>.</li>
<li>Our Director of Engineering and lead bbPress developer, John Jacoby, will be <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/session/sweet-bbpress-secrets/">giving away some bbPress secrets</a>.</li>
<li>Senior Engineer Eric Mann, hot on the heels of his talk at jQuery Conference in Russia, is <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/session/php-unit-testing/">teaching PHP Unit Testing</a>, a skill set crucial to the future of WordPress.</li>
<li>Are you afraid of the command line? Senior Engineer John Bloch, just coming off the TechCrunch.com relaunch last week, &nbsp;will teach you to <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/session/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-command-line/">fear the command line no more</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, Engineer Kelly Dwan will <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/session/ux-for-theme-and-plugin-developers/">co-lead a Friday workshop focused on theme and plug-in UX</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find more 10uppers roaming the halls and manning the 10up table (<strong>did someone say free swag?</strong>): local Senior Engineer Dave Ross and prolific core contributor (find her face on your credits screen) Helen&nbsp;Hou-Sandi.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/2013/10/23/welcome-10up-as-a-platinum-sponsor/">guest blog post on the WordCamp Boston website</a> for more reminiscing about 10up and Boston connections, like our work for <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/">Boston Magazine</a>. If you’ll be in town, find a 10upper, visit our table, be sure to see our talks, and enjoy lunch – it’s on&nbsp;us!</p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will be leading a 2-hour workshop for participating organizations and volunteers on how to better leverage WordPress on their projects during the weekend and beyond. Many of the participating organizations are either already using WordPress, or have identified their project as requiring a WordPress component. In my session I will cover a variety of WordPress topics ranging from how to start using WordPress for the first time, to using some it’s more advanced APIs, to simple every day tips and tricks. The session will be Saturday morning from 10am to noon, and is open to the general public.</p>
<p>For more information about GiveCamp visit <a href="http://seattlegivecamp.org/" target="_blank">http://seattlegivecamp.org/</a> and follow them on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/seattlegivecamp" target="_blank">@SeattleGivecamp</a>. Best of luck to all the project teams this weekend, and if you’re in the Seattle area I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Although I only lived in the Midwest (specifically Wichita) for a brief 11 months, I enjoyed my time there and am very excited to head back to the area on Friday, September 27, to speak at <a href="http://200ok.us/">200 OK</a>, Oklahoma’s premier web conference. I’m excited to be on a <a href="http://200ok.us/speakers/">roster</a> that includes a fellow WordPress developer from iThemes, as well as representatives of other open source supporters such as Adobe, GitHub, Mozilla, and Etsy. The WordPress Foundation is also proud to be sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>I’ll be talking about <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/tailoring-the-wordpress-admin-for-workflows/">Tailoring the WordPress Admin for Workflows</a>; not an uncommon topic for me, but to a non-WordCamp audience and as always, I’ll be similarly tailoring my own presentation. <a href="http://200ok.us/registration">Tickets have sold out</a>, but there’s a waitlist. If you’re in the area, I’d love to meet you there!</p>

</p>
<p>A few months ago, as 10up’s Portland contingent continued to grow, we decided that it was time to put down roots in the city and <a href="https://10up.com/blog/portland-office-opening/">set up our first brick-and-mortar</a>&nbsp;office. To celebrate our new space, we hosted an open house on the eve of this year’s <a href="http://2013.portland.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Portland</a>. We <a href="https://10up.com/blog/portland-open-house/">invited the Portland and WordPress community</a> to come check out our new office, and meet some of our team.</p>
<p>Senior Designer Megan Gray (visiting from Orange Country) and I spent the week preparing the office for the open house. Located in the former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Cracker_Company_Building">Oregon Cracker Building</a>, our space was very much a blank canvas. With a nod to the history of the space – and the work ahead of us – we set out give the office an industrial vibe.</p>
<p>In just one week’s time, we transformed the office into a warm, welcoming atmosphere for Portland 10uppers (and their guests) to collaborate and host community events. By the end of the week, the office was full of 10uppers – both local and out-of-town – enjoying the space and the opportunity to collaborate under one roof.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">On Saturday morning, I’ll be presenting <a title="Drew Jaynes&#39; talk &#39;There&#39;s A Filter For That&#39;" href="http://2013.albuquerque.wordcamp.org/session/theres-an-api-for-that/"><strong>There’s a Filter for That</strong></a></span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">, focusing on the ins and outs of the WordPress Filters API.&nbsp;</span>In this developer-focused talk, I’ll introduce some common (and uncommon) filters designed to spark discussion.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The timing of this talk is exciting for me, in part due to my heavy involvement in the inline-docs initiative planned for WordPress 3.7. In this new and, frankly, huge undertaking, the team is&nbsp;attempting to document all actions and filters in WordPress core in the new <a title="WordPress Developer Resources" href="http://developer.wordpress.org/">WordPress Developer Resources</a>&nbsp;announced at WordCamp San Francisco this year.&nbsp;This talk also goes hand-in-hand with the <a title="Drew Jayne&#39;s Filters of the Day blog" href="http://fotd.werdswords.com/">Filters of the Day</a> blog series I started earlier this summer.</span></p>
<p>There are <a title="Tickets to WordCamp Albuquerque 2013" href="http://2013.albuquerque.wordcamp.org/tickets/">still a few tickets left</a>, so come out to the beautiful Duke City this weekend and catch me and my fellow community members at WordCamp Albuquerque!</p>

<p>About one month ago, the 8th annual <a title="WordCamp San Francisco 2013" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a>&nbsp;brought&nbsp;WordPress fans from all over the world together for two days of talks and a Contributor Day, one of the largest single gatherings of WordPress volunteers ever. 10up was proud to feature four team members as presenters this year – more than any company, with the exception of <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>. Several other team members came along for the ride, hailing from places like Chicago, Colorado, Washington, and Virginia. Web Engineer Aaron Holbrook even joined the conference volunteer crew!</p>

<p>If you were unable to attend – or if you attended, but missed a session – have no fear: thanks to WordPress.tv, you can watch any of the <a title="WordPress TV WordCamp San Francisco 2013" href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-san-francisco-2013/">25+ talks</a> from the comfort of your office or living room. One of the lesser-known community resources for staying in the loop and learning new skills, WordPress.tv features hundreds of high-quality videos, including recorded WordCamp talks from across the globe. Most WordCamp talks are posted within a few weeks following a camp, so while you miss out on the community aspects of a WordCamp, you can still get the knowledge and put faces to names. <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/wordcamp-san-francisco-wordpress-tv/#more-10968" class="more-link">Read More <span class="screen-reader-text">on Grab a Snack and Catch Up on WordCamp San Francisco on WordPress.tv</span></a></p>

<p>This weekend, 10up is sponsoring WordCamps on both North American coasts, as&nbsp;<a title="WordCamp Providence 2013" href="http://2013.providence.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Providence</a> and <a title="WordCamp Vancouver 2013" href="http://2013.vancouver.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Vancouver</a>&nbsp;host their annual conference. 10uppers are also busy preparing to play their part at both camps.</p>
<p>As an organizer for WordCamp Providence – an outgrowth of my organizer role at our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPressProvidence/">local meet up</a> –&nbsp;I have the honor of delivering opening remarks for Friday’s sessions and closing remarks for the entire camp on Saturday. Providence is close to our team’s heart.&nbsp;Our President started the meet up here back in 2010, and lived here for over 10 years.&nbsp;John Jacoby, our new Director of Web Engineering, lived in the city for two years, from late 2010 to early 2013, and helped organize last year’s WordCamp.&nbsp;Jess Jurick, Director of Web Strategy, started her career at 10up while living here.&nbsp;We couldn’t help but step up with a top-level, Anchor Sponsorship. The camp has a great line up, including a number of 10uppers.</p>

<p>Hey again, PDX!

We think this is the perfect occasion for a grand opening, and we’d like to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7138604759">invite you to join us</a>!</p>

<p><a title="WordCamp San Francisco 2013" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a> was the first ever WordCamp, organized by WordPress co-founder <a title="Matt Mullenweg" href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> back in 2006. It has since grown into one of the largest WordCamps in the United States, and is considered WordPress’s canonical annual community event. I’m excited to reveal that we’ll have eight 10uppers in attendance, four of whom will be presenting.</p>

<p>One of our newest employees, <a href="https://10up.com/blog/grant-landram-joins-10up/">Grant Landram</a>, will be attending WordCamp San Francisco for the first time. Grant is excited to experience the WordCamp that started this international phenomena and meet WordCampers from around the world. As a WordCamp organizer in Seattle, he’s eager to learn from the organizing team and bring that knowledge back home.&nbsp;Grant’s presentation explores collaboration with <a title="Bridging the Chasm: Working with Non Technical Stakeholders" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/session/bridging-the-chasm-working-with-non-technical-stakeholders/">non-technical stakeholders</a>, and offers an anecdotal overview of the pitfalls technical personnel may encounter when working with non-technical stakeholders. He’ll cover techniques for identifying and understanding a stakeholders’ true knowledge, and actions that help non-technical participants follow technical conversations. Grant is also volunteering at the Happiness Bar on Friday, so stop by to chat with him if you’re going!</p>
<p><a href="https://10up.com/blog/eric-mann-joins-10up/">Eric Mann</a> will also be attending WordCamp San Francisco for the first time, and is eager to connect with online collaborators he’s engaged on Twitter and IRC.&nbsp;Eric will be giving a short talk on Saturday morning, highlighting ways developers can <a title="Automated WordPress Development" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/session/automated-wordpress-development/">automate their coding process</a> using Grunt. Like his presentation in Seattle earlier this year, this version will focus on the goals of automation and practical tools, along with a live demo. At 10up, we’ve built two fantastic tools that leverage Grunt for WordPress development: a template that builds the foundation for a new plugin and one that builds the foundation for a new theme.&nbsp;Eric also built out a template that <a href="https://github.com/ericmann/grunt-wp-underscores">builds a new theme based on Automattic’s _s (Underscores) starter theme</a>. Attendees will walk out with access to plenty of tools to kick-start, simplify, and improve their development processes.</p>

<p>Back in June, I attended <a title="JSConf Blog" href="https://10up.com/blog/10up.com/blog/jsconf-2013/">JSConf</a>, a three-day JavaScript Conference, where I participated in the Yammer and SpringSource track. JSConf is one of the best JavaScript conferences in the world; every talk was enlightening, every speaker was inspiring, and all the content was exceptional. I can’t even choose a favorite speaker!</p>

<p>The highlight of the event was the Bitovi NodeBots event on the second day. The event kicked off at 9:00 AM with an introductory course in <a href="http://nodebots.io/">NodeBots</a> and how they can help us. Rick Waldron provided examples and connected us to the <a title="Johnny-Five Library" href="https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five">Johnny-Five Library</a> to get us started.</p>

<p>Last week, Jeremy Felt, Carl Danley, and I attended <a title="jQuery Conference Portland 2013" href="http://events.jquery.org/2013/portland/">jQuery Conference Portland 2013</a>. The Conference was a great chance to connect with and listen to web professionals experienced with <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>

<p>From keynotes explaining the jQuery server infrastructure – an elegant use of Github and Grunt.js enabling websites to commit using pull requests – to speakers like Patrick Camacho, who detailed Twitter’s use of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for <a href="http://crashlytics.com/">Crashlytics</a>&nbsp;(Carl’s conversation with Patrick about Backbone design patterns was his highlight),&nbsp;every speaker offered well-informed, broad, and &nbsp;fascinating content.&nbsp;In addition to solid presentations consistently interlaced with humor, participants had the chance to pick speakers’ brains.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to speak before my largest audience on the importance of Unit Testing in a presentation I titled “Minutes Now Will Save Hours Later.”&nbsp;In contrast to presentations I’ve offered at other conferences, I’m&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;getting questions nearly one week later.&nbsp; It’s wonderful to have such an interested, interactive, and enthused crowd!<br>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>This is really neat!</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Kind words from <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a>‘s rock star team after deploying <a href="https://github.com/10up/jetpack-carousel-ads">our new ad integration extension</a> to <a href="http://jetpack.me/2012/07/13/jetpack-1-5-with-carousel/">Jetpack’s Carousel</a>.&nbsp;Built for <a href="http://9to5mac.com/">9to5mac.com</a>, this extension&nbsp;appends a custom image to the full screen carousel modal. We’re excited to share it with the WordPress community, along with a few cautions and insights.</p>
<h2>Rules are rules: no AdSense</h2>
<p>If you were hoping to inject AdSense ads, we’re sorry to disappoint: <a title="http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=48182 " href="http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=48182">AdSense policies</a> clearly stipulate that an ad may not be “Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders.” You may, of course, be able to leverage our approach for other, more forgiving ad networks. We envision the typical use case will involve an internal “house” ad image.</p>
<h2>Hooking into Jetpack with JavaScript</h2>
<p>Because the modal Jetpack Carousel is generated entirely by JavaScript, classic WordPress PHP API hooks do not apply. Fortunately, JetPack provides 2 JavaScript hooks: <code>jp_carousel.afterOpen</code> and <code>jp_carousel.beforeClose</code>. We hooked into afterOpen – which fires every time the carousel is generated – on <a href="https://github.com/10up/jetpack-carousel-ads/blob/master/js/carousel-ads.js#L14">line 14 of carousel-ads.js</a>:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">$( document.body ).on( 'jp_carousel.afterOpen', SELF.insertAd );</pre>

<p>Since I’m always looking for ways to improve my productivity, I constantly strive to streamline my development workflow. Lately, that meant adding <a title="Grunt" href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to the mix.</p>
<p>Grunt is a scripting tool that helps automate certain development tasks using JavaScript. &nbsp;It runs on top of <a title="Node JS" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> in your local environment, and can handle just about any task you can imagine – from <a title="grunt-contrib-jshint" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint">linting</a> your scripts to <a title="grunt-contrib-cssmin" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin">minfying</a> your stylesheets to running <a title="grunt-contrib-qunit" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit">unit tests</a>.&nbsp;A few months ago, at <a title="Coming to Portland: 10up’s First Internal Developer Summit" href="https://10up.com/blog/10up-2013-developer-summit/">our first summit</a>,&nbsp; our entire team had the chance to play with Grunt. As a result, most of us are&nbsp;incorporating&nbsp;it into our regular workflow.</p>
<p>To make it easier to use Grunt with new &nbsp;WordPress projects, we’ve created two project templates: <a title="grunt-wp-plugin" href="https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-plugin">grunt-wp-plugin</a> and <a title="grunt-wp-theme" href="https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-theme">grunt-wp-theme</a>. &nbsp;These templates make it easy to kickstart development of a new WordPress plugin or theme by building out the directory structure and project’s core files for you.</p>
<p>If you’re building a plugin, you will start out with the core plugin file, the basic WordPress.org readme standard, and a basic directory structure for all of your PHP, CSS, JS, and image assets. &nbsp;The template also configures your plugin textdomain and registers a few useful constants and core functions. &nbsp;Here’s an example of grunt-wp-plugin in action:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Back in February, we applied&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a title="We the People" href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">We the People</a>‘s second ever White House Hackathon. The event is an open-ended civic hack day where developers of all stripes from across the United States are invited to create applications in languages like Python and JavaScript. The purpose of the event was to create resources for websites, smartphones and other platforms that build on&nbsp;<a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">We the People</a>. As a Senior Web Engineer, I had the&nbsp;privilege of&nbsp;representing WordPress at the White House, alongside fellow 10upper Christopher Cochran and&nbsp;<a title="Automattic" href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>‘s&nbsp;Mo Jangda. Given just how small and selective the event was, we were deeply honored to be accepted and participate.</p>

<p>As a <a title="WordPress VIP Hosting" href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a> featured partner, 10up was invited to participate in this year’s&nbsp;<a title="WordPress.com VIP Intensive Developer Workshop page" href="http://vip.wordpress.com/vip-workshop-2013/">VIP Intensive Developer Workshop</a>&nbsp;in Napa, California. I had the pleasure of representing 10up at the event (although our Director of Strategic Engineering managed to make a cameo appearance, too). Hosted at the amazing <a title="The Caneros Inn and Resort Website" href="http://www.thecarnerosinn.com/">Carneros Inn and Resort</a>, surrounded by vineyards, a group of roughly 50 VIP developers and 20 Automatticians spent two and a half days digging deep into the WordPress.com VIP platform.</p>
<p>After arriving on Monday, May 13th, the event kicked off with a meet and greet, where I had the chance to chat with representatives from media outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Penske Media Corporation, in addition to Automatticians I’d only collaborated with online. The meals we shared all week long were delicious, matched only by the stimulating conversations and the content to come.</p>

<p>I’ve published the slides to YouTube, since a large portion of the presentation includes screen recordings, demoing some built in features, plug-ins, and showcases.

<p>Last week, Royal Pingdom released their <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/05/07/wordpress-top-100-blogs/">annual analysis of the top 100 blogs</a>, based on <a title="Technorati Authority" href="http://technorati.com/what-is-technorati-authority">site linking behavior and categorization over a 6 month time frame</a>&nbsp;as collected by Technorati (a debatable, but reasonable metric). Royal Pingdom has pointed out that 52% of the sites are built on WordPress. Comparing this list to last year’s list, we see that WordPress’s dominance as a publishing platform rose from 48% to 52%. At the same time, competing publishing formats like Drupal and MoveableType have dropped or remained constant.</p>
<p>The news for 10up is even better: we’ve provided direct service for 8 of the blogs on the list. <a title="TechCrunch Showcase" href="https://10up.com/showcase/techcrunch/">TechCrunch</a> moved up into the top five. <a title="9to5mac Showcase" href="https://10up.com/showcase/9to5mac/">9to5mac</a> moved up two spaces from #33 to #31. <a title="Deadline.com" href="https://10up.com/blog/www.deadline.com/">Deadline</a> maintained its place on the list at #26.

<p>This coming week I’ll be participating in and speaking at the annual <a href="http://www.cmsexpo.net/">CMS Expo</a>&nbsp;in Chicago. CMS Expo educates and informs business leaders, content marketers, website implementors, and other professionals looking for an in-depth review of the latest web-based publishing solutions. With three full days of content and more than 50 speakers, CMS Expo covers a cross-section of popular content management systems, including Drupal, Joomla, MODx, and of our favorite, WordPress. I’ll be one of four speakers offering insight and content focused on WordPress.</p>

</p>
<p>When adding an action or a filter to WordPress, the third parameter allows you to adjust priority. In this way, multiple bits of code can determine the order that they should execute without having to rely on the order that PHP actually parses them.</p>
<p>Generally, there are no minimums or maximum limits (other than those imposed by PHP itself) for priority, but there’s a very good reason to give consideration to when your code runs. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Widget registration should be hooked to ‘widgets_init’ as in the following code:<br>
<code></code></p>
<pre>function mytheme_register_widgets() {
register_widget( 'Mytheme_Widget' );
}
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'mytheme_register_widgets' );</pre>
<p>This is also the hook used internally by WordPress to take all the registered widgets and create a global array, <code>$wp_registered_widgets</code>. Specifically, this is in the WP_Widget_Factory class’s constructor function which is called once in wp-settings.php, immediately before the ‘setup_theme’ action hook.</p>

<p><strong>We’re proud to formally announce the opening of our first office in Portland, Oregon this month.&nbsp;</strong>Portland has an incredible online media community, second only to mega-metropolises like New York City and San Francisco, without the high cost of living.&nbsp;As a <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2013/how-many-companies-are-100-distributed/">distributed company</a>, we find the best strategy, creative, WordPress engineering, and systems talent from across the United States. As it turns out, 5 of our 25 full-time employees live in the Portland metro area, with two more living just a three hour drive (or train ride!) away in greater Seattle.</p>

<p>In short, this expanding, thriving technology community is the perfect atmosphere for 10up to begin growing its distributed roots into brick and mortar hubs.</p>
<p>Our Portland team is excited to have a local hub, and anticipate working out of our office for more than half of their working hours. Other 10uppers from across the country have already expressed an eagerness to visit the office throughout the year.</p>

<p>This past week I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://convergese.com/">ConvergeSE</a>, a three-day web conference held annually in Columbia, South Carolina. Over 400 participants gathered to discuss and explore up-and-coming trends, technologies, and disciplines in web design and development. Speakers ranged from presidents of agencies, to Google employees, to house hold names in the design community. &nbsp;It was intense content in a laid back atmosphere, between venue hopping in downtown Columbia, food carts lunches, and an art museum party. The event was hugely successful, and it’s easy to tell why just by looking at their <a href="http://convergese.com/speakers.php">speaker roster</a> and the <a href="http://convergese.com/schedule.php">schedule of activities</a>.</p>
<h2>Build Responsively</h2>

<p>The highlight was Mr. Callahan’s application of a preprocessor called&nbsp;<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>,&nbsp;which he uses to generate a single CSS file (improving performance)&nbsp;for visitors using older versions of Internet Explorer or modern browsers. Combing imports, a <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/SB-Media">custom mix-in</a>&nbsp;(written by his company), and some conditional tags, his approach generates a&nbsp;stylesheet with efficient, modern techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">media queries</a>&nbsp;served to modern browsers, and another stylesheet optimized&nbsp;for older browsers.</p>
<p>Ben wrapped up by reviewing design patterns arising as responsive web design gains popularity. It is truly amazing to watch the web mature as we transition from a desktop-centric experience to an increasingly mobile-centric audience.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a title="Code with me: Portland" href="http://codewithme.us/portland/index.html">Code with me: Portland</a> is a two day, student-mentor workshop that teaches journalists the foundations of coding in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp;Founded by Sisi Wei and Tom Giratikanon, Code with me has been successful in Washington DC and Miami, and Code with me: Portland promises to be the biggest workshop yet, with 36 student and 22 mentors! With about two students to every mentor, the classes are very personal and hands-on. Between learning how to code, the journalists use mentor time to help with personal projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Portland’s organizer, a former WordPress.com VIP support engineer, helped organize the workshop and invited Jeremy Felt and me to be mentors. The mentors are talented and diverse, ranging from <a title="team 10up" href="https://10up.com/about/">10uppers</a> and <a title="Automattic" href="http://automattic.com/">Automatticians</a>&nbsp;to designers, developers, and editors from newspapers like the <a title="Seattle Times" href="http://seattletimes.com/html/home/index.html">Seattle Times</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The primary goal of <a title="Code with me" href="http://codewithme.us/">Code with me</a> is to help journalists understand code so that they can better integrate into their work. Many of the attendees were inspired after reading the New York Times’s “<a title="Snow Fall: The Avalance at Tunnel Creek" href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek">Snow Fall</a>”, a showcase for crafting and coding an online presentation around a single, great story. Snow Fall is a great example of how technology can enhance storytelling without restraining or complicating it.</p>

<p>Less than one month ago, <a title="Global News" href="http://globalnews.ca/">Global News</a> released a brand new website, engineered by 10up and hosted on&nbsp;<a title="WordPress.com VIP" href="https://10up.com/blog/vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a>.&nbsp;With features like content tailored automatically to the visitor’s geolocation, highly curated home pages, and beautiful responsive design, we couldn’t be more proud to have been part of the Global News redesign team. &nbsp;You can read more about our involvement by checking out our <a title="Global News redesign" href="https://10up.com/showcase/global-news/">extended case study</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/blog/">WordPress.com VIP publisher blog</a>&nbsp;posted a <a title="Global News Q&amp;A: The Technology Behind Their Responsive Redesign" href="http://vip.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/global-news-qa/">Q&amp;A with Keith Robinson</a>, Manager of Digital Products at Global News, where he took some time to highlight some of our contributions:</p>
<blockquote><p>“10up helped us come up with a curation system that powers a lot of the site: the navigation, carousel, featured story, top story. It’s all one system that gives different choices.”</p>
<p>“We engaged with 10up in the fall to do the WordPress integration…we were very fortunate to hire some really top talent to work with us, and we’ve been working with really good partners.”</p>
<p>“10up brought a lot in terms of being able to listen to our needs and turn it into a functional site. They were great for us because we were at a stage where we needed things done very quickly and needed to discuss exactly what we were looking to do and how we were looking to do it–they helped us go from the discovery process to the implementation…we really benefited from the partnership and they were good to work with.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Developer Summit was a few weeks ago, but our team is still buzzing. I asked a few my teammates to share their main take away from our first ever <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/04/developer-summit-wrap-up/">Developer Summit</a>&nbsp;– here’s what they came back with:</p>
<p><strong>Jake Goldman:&nbsp;</strong>There were so many highlights: learning from the smartest minds I’ve ever worked with about unit testing, advanced JavaScript, and Vagrant… seeing a great group of Portland-area WordPress pros show up at our social… seeing a few members of our team in person for the first time. The real highlight was being able to sit back and watch the team brainstorm the big process and technique questions we confront, so effectively. It’s one thing to have great “online” chemistry in IRC chat rooms, small video conferences, and status blogs, but it was amazing to see just how much chemistry this team has when we get together in person – more than any brick and mortar group I’ve ever led or been a part of.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Dewey:&nbsp;</strong>On the first day of our summit, only a few people had lunch together. On the second day of our summit, there were a few groups of folks in different spots. On the last day of our summit, everyone was eating lunch together in the same area. Seeing everyone come together organically proved that we actually do have a team, not a group of individuals, and that has tremendous value.</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to learn about WordPress, but never had a chance to attend a <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>, now there’s an amazing opportunity to attend WordCamp-style lectures from home! It’s called <a href="http://wordsesh.org/">WordSesh</a>, and we’re proud to be a big part of it.</p>

<p>At our <a title="10up Developer Summit Wrap-Up" href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/04/developer-summit-wrap-up/">10up Developer Summit</a>, we collectively decided to document our workflow, tools, and process. With a handful of employees it’s easy to spread collective knowledge, but we’re growing fast and now have a need to document web technologies such as Vagrant, Git, and Grunt; who to contact and how to use our internal IRC channel; and how our staging servers are set up.</p>
<p>But who writes those docs, where do they go, and what should they look like?</p>
<p>Earlier this week I attended <a href="http://writethedocs.com/">Write The Docs</a>: a conference for technical writers that was created in the domain of software and web development.&nbsp;Many of the talks at this conference were devoted to who should write the docs. The consensus is that engineers compose technical documentation which is then edited by more experienced writers. Other presentations covered technical writing itself, careers, and documentation platforms.</p>
<p>Our code is well documented – and soon our internal processes will be too. Our engineers are already documentarians. The docs are being assembled in an internal WordPress-powered website and I’ve started the initial concept of a theme to make those docs easily readable and navigable.</p>
<p>If you’d like to help us write our docs, strategy, proposals, and emails, we are <a href="mailto:jobs@10up.com">hiring web strategists</a>.</p>

<p>10up’s Developer Summit was an amazing experience. In addition to meeting one another in person (a first, for some of us), we were treated to fantastic workshops covering everything from WordPress&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>&nbsp;to simulating live environments in <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to advanced JavaScript performance techniques. We’re lucky to have an incredibly smart and diverse staff, over half which contributed to the presentations. Jeremy Felt and Carl Danley, two of our amazing Web Engineers, organized the <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2013/04/preparing-for-developer-summit/">entire conference</a> and ensured that every member of our team would learn something new.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the new Web Strategist here at 10up, I’m still getting to know the team. Naturally, I was very excited to learn that I would be attending our Developer Summit in Portland on my second week! To find out more, I sat down with Jeremy Felt and Carl Danley (over Skype) to find out just what the Summit is all about and how it came to be.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How many people are you expecting at the Summit?</strong><br>
<strong>Jermey Felt:</strong> [Almost] everybody from 10up. 22 people total.<br>
<em>Editor’s note:</em> Our Operations Manager, Pat, is holding down the back office in Sacramento during the Summit, and our Director of User Interface Engineering, Helen, just began her maternity leave.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>There are many diverse jobs/responsibilities at 10up; how do you plan to cater to them all in one collective conference?</strong><br>
<strong>JF:</strong> Originally this was planned as just a Developer Summit, which is still the core focus, different web engineering technologies… [Director of Web Strategy] Jess Jurick proposed that we also have a mini project management conference, which she and [Senior Web Strategist] Megan Gray will handle somewhat separately… everyone will get a handle on the engineering concepts, and be involved in the lectures in some way… The workshop style will help us make sure nobody gets lost.<br>
<strong>Carl Danley:</strong> The focus is primarily on the attendees, not the presenters… we’ll be there supplementing what they hear and helping them master the techniques.</p>

<p>Excitement abounds at 10up as our team prepares to descend on Portland for 3 days for our first Developer Summit.&nbsp;We’ve finalized a fantastic schedule of topical workshops, where the team will focus on adapting and strengthening our collaborative project engineering practices.</p>
<p><div style="width:300px;height:200px;background-image:url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,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);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:300px 200px;" data-xblocker="blocked"></div></p>
<p>Rather than adopting the speaker oriented structure of a standard conference, we’re breaking things down into multiple hour long workshops, in which a short presentation by a designated expert will be followed by hands on application by every engineer on the team. Each day, when we walk out of the door, we’ll have gained valuable experience that can be applied immediately to client projects.</p>
<p>We’re also excited to simply hang out as a team. This will be the second time we’ve gathered in whole and we have quite a bit planned – including a 10up community social! (Details to come)</p>
<p>As we progress through our workshops, we’ll be documenting as much as possible and will be looking to pass knowledge back to the community.

<p>I recently became a <strong>part of the WordPress Boston organizing team</strong>. My first organizing event is also the first ever <a href="http://bwphackday.eventbrite.com/">WordPress Boston Hack Day</a>, which is taking place next Saturday from 10am-6pm at Bocoup. It’s a day dedicated to developers working together on core WordPress tickets. We’re going to start with an introduction by lead developers Mark Jaquith and Andrew Nacin. Mark will fill everyone in on the state of the development cycle since WordPress 3.5 came out, and tell us how we can help. It’s a great opportunity for new contributors to get their feet wet, as we spend the day coding, testing, and documenting.</p>
<p>I’m really happy to announce that 10up is going to be sponsoring the hackathon! This is sure to be a productive day, so if you’re in the Boston area and looking to get your name in the credits, join us at Bocoup. And if you love hacking core, and want to do more of that, <a href="https://10up.com/contact/">get in touch</a> &nbsp;– we’re always looking for your type!</p>

<p>As a Design Engineer here at 10up, I’m looking forward to bringing ideas back from <a href="http://convergese.com/schedule.php">sessions</a> like “Responsive JavaScript”, “Performance in a Responsive World”, and “Building Animations with CSS3.” It looks to be&nbsp;a fun weekend filled with learning from peers, networking, and experiencing everything that the event has to offer.</p>

<p>Conferences like HigherEdWeb New England inspire schools to implement smarter, more engaging websites that better tout the outstanding education New England schools deliver, attract superior applicants in the age of social media and smartphones, and increase administrative efficiency. <strong>The values of openness, community, and meritocracy espoused by open source projects like WordPress are shared by higher education and shared by 10up.&nbsp;</strong>As a graduate of a New England university, the University of Rhode Island, I’m especially proud that our team is supporting a conference that shares our values and pushes large institutions like universities to embrace the benefits of changing technology.</p>
<p>You can catch Jess, our Director of Web Strategy, and Craig, a Senior Web Strategist, at the conference. Craig in particular is no stranger to higher ed websites, having led projects for the University of Vermont and The New England Culinary Institute.</p>

<p>On Monday, February 18, 10up will turn 2 years old (more on that in a future post). On Tuesday, February 19, a handful of team 10up employees will celebrate across the country by doing what we’ve done all along – playing an active role in the WordPress community at three different meet ups on the 19th (plus a belated fourth event on the 26th)!</p>

<p>At 10up, we say we’re always hiring, and it’s true. We’re always looking for WordPress engineers and web strategists, but right now we’ve especially got our eyes on hiring another WordPress developer with a focus on the front-end. We offer a competitive full-time salary and benefits. If you’re interested, send a resumé and code samples (like a WordPress theme) to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jobs@10up.com">jobs@10up.com</a>.</p>

<p>It seems fitting, then, that the three of us: Jake, Eric, and myself are returning to <a title="Phoenix WordCamp 2013 official site" href="http://2013.phoenix.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Phoenix 2013</a> as speakers.</p>
<p>Jake is attending as a rockstar presenter. Eric and I are teaching Friday classes and Sunday sessions. I’ll be talking about developer tools and techniques. Eric will talk about leveraging WordPress and open source publishing in developing or low-tech environments. Jake will dive into the “core of WordPress core”, studying its most base level information architecture and database schema.</p>
<p>If you happen to be headed to WordCamp Phoenix this January, we’d love to meet up and say hello. We’re always looking for new employees and great WordPress stories.</p>

<p>As a designer and programmer here at 10up, I have the unique opportunity to see my design through from the first wireframe to the fin</p>
<p>al product. There’s nothing that makes me grimace more than turning control over to a client only to see the design fall apart with use. Ensuring that as little as possible is “breakable” is on top of my quality assurance list. WordPress’s native, customizable image sizes is a common cause of breakdowns.</p>
<h2>How I use image sizes in designs</h2>
<p>Nothing disturbs my blank white canvas in Photoshop until I have set the grid and guides that will determine the structure of the layout. As I begin to flesh out the design, image placeholders find their way in, and they’re always made to fit within those guidelines. Common placeholders include a featured slider image, a thumbnail for the main index/search/archive post list view, and a special size for the “image” <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats">post format</a>. Most of the time, I want images used within posts and pages to use these same consistent sizes so that the layout stays as clean as possible. Call me OCD, it wouldn’t be the first time. (<em>Editor’s note: all great designers are a bit OCD!)</em></p>
<p>I could create predefined image sizes for each call to an image attachment (and I often do at least one or two of those), but defining an endless set of sizes has a real performance toll every time an image is uploaded, not to mention the bloating effect on the upload directory. If I define 5 custom sizes, and we add that to the 3 default sizes (thumbnail, medium, and large), we wind up with 9 sizes, counting the original. That’s 9 images generated every time an image is uploaded to the site. I always try to avoid the weight and clutter by using the default image sizes.</p>
<h2>Enforcing the image sizes</h2>
<p>It may have crossed your mind that this breaks my own OCD rule, as administrators can adjust default image sizes from the Media settings page. But wait – that’s what this post is all about! Let’s get to some code.</p>

<p>On November 11 to 13, I was privileged to attend <a href="http://techonomy.com/conf/12-tucson/">Techonomy ’12 in Tucson, Arizona</a>, with 10up founder Jake Goldman.<em>&nbsp;</em>Techonomy ’12 in Tuscon featured exciting content and internationally-known business, science, and political leaders focused on the intersection of technology and the global economy. Sponsored by companies like Forbes Magazine, speakers included technology, finance, education, and publishing luminaries like Steve Forbes, EMC CEO Joe Tucci, AI pioneer and author Ray Kurzweiler, and Nielsen president Steve Hasker.</p>
<p>Techonomy founder David Kirkpatrick led and moderated the 3 days of talk about the accelerating speed of technological progress, driven by increasing availability of the Internet and mobile devices. And that change is not limited to just technological progress, but to human progress as well: the technology-empowered individual is affecting a major shift in economic and political power on a global scale.</p>

<p>This is a post about a WordCamp. It is far from the first one: we sponsor and send people to a number of them each year . This past weekend I had the opportunity to speak at WordCamp Toronto: Developers.</p>
<p>Toronto has now held the second developer-centric WordCamp. The idea—as it was explained during the opening remarks—is that these are viability tests of niche WordCamps.</p>
<p>The Toronto organizers are (rightly) considering the test a success. They sold out tickets with an attendance near 300 and a slate of talented speakers despite Hurricane Sandy forcing a last-minute call for speakers.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to speak about how to create websites tailored to the people using them through a process called Interaction Design. This half science, half design discipline answers questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the site being created for, what do we mean by “user?”</li>
<li>What tasks and goals should this website address?</li>
<li>How will someone interact with the website?</li>
</ul>

<p>WordPress 3.5 is almost upon us, and I was excited to learn that <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sort-query-by-post-in/">my Sort Query by Post In plug-in</a> had been folded into core, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13729">thanks to a ticket</a> I opened and submitted a patch for some time ago. Sort Query by Post In allowed developers to return posts from a post query (WP_Query) in the order designated using the <em>post__in</em> parameter.</p>
<p>Now that identical functionality is in core,&nbsp;I wanted to update my plug-in to automatically disable itself – with a notice – for users running 3.5 or newer. This code would also prevent the plug-in from being activated if installed on 3.5 or newer. Surprisingly, there seemed to be a dearth of good tutorials, so I came up with my own solution.</p>

<p>We do quite a bit of development on the WordPress.com VIP infrastructure, where sites are generally domain-mapped and theme files are loaded over their CDN. Recently we developed a site where the webfont needed was not available through a hosted service, so @font-face was used to include the font files. Once the site was off of our local and staging environments and moved onto WordPress.com, however, we discovered a number of issues concerning the fonts.</p>

<p>This week, I had the privilege of attending the first ever <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2012/developer-summit/">jQuery Developer Summit</a>. I spent two full days hacking jQuery and collaborating with the jQuery team and community to squash as many bugs as possible. The Summit was held at the AOL campus in Dulles, VA.</p>

<p>I was assigned to Table 2 where our goal was to fix jQuery bugs. We covered a vast array of topics including <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt.js</a>, Git and <a href="http://swarm.jquery.org/">TestSwarm</a>. It was refreshing to see so many JavaScript engineers get together to talk about complex JavaScript bugs and solutions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we kicked off the Summit with several brief presentations from various jQuery team members and discussed the goals for each table. After this, we jumped into code head first. Dave Methvin, president of the jQuery foundation, was at Table 2 leading the bug assignments and assisting us whenever possible. The bug I was assigned to fix (<a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12519">#12519</a>) branched into many other conversations that made us question the design principles of the correlated code that the bug referenced. After rationalizing the best way to address these issues with Dave and several jQuery members, we finally decided on a solution. I committed the changes Tuesday morning and my pull request was approved shortly thereafter, representing my very first <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/976">jQuery core patch</a> on behalf of 10up!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to continuing to contribute to the jQuery community and to exploring new ways to integrate advanced jQuery solutions into WordPress.</p>

<p>WordCamp Vancouver is coming up quick and 10up is excited not only to be a bronze level sponsor, but to also represent with three developers from our Portland contingent.<a href="https://10up.com/?attachment_id=7208" rel="attachment wp-att-7208"><br>

<p>I’ll be starting the developer track off on Saturday with a talk on ‘Calm and Simple Code’. We’ll have a good time going through the reasons and best practices for remaining simple and coding with purpose when working with WordPress as a framework.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, Zack will be tackling the topic of cache invalidation in WordPress. It’s often easy to get started with the WordPress transient API and object caching in general, but things can quickly turn difficult when you start looking for the best approach to invalidating your caches to keep your data fresh.</p>
<p>And to top it off, we’ll be there for the first ever BuddyCamp the following day!</p>
<p>Be sure to look for us in our 10up shirts on Saturday, though we may change for your benefit on Sunday. Any topic is welcome. We can help you with your WordPress questions, converse about some geeky technical issue, or give you an overview of 10up and what kind of work we do on a daily basis. We’re always interested and we’re always hiring!</p>

While it’s a broad topic and talk, I’m hoping to present a trimmer version that leaves more room for conversation and engagement. Hope to see some familiar and meet some new faces in&nbsp;LA!</p>

The talk highlights tools and resources for enterprise implementations, marketing tactics and resources for pursuing large scale clients, and even takes a hard look at what our platform needs to do better (multilingual). Above all, it explores how we, as a community, can better pursue large businesses and make WordPress not just the #1 web publishing platform for small to medium sized organizations, but the #1 platform for large scale implementations.</p>
<p>Meaningful conversation and education about WordPress in enterprise is really critical for ushering in the next stage of WordPress’s growth, which is why I’ve taken this conversation to a few WordCamps in the last few months. I debuted the talk in Orange County, but the Boston version was the first to make it up to WordPress.tv.

<p>This weekend will bring Zack and I to the Midwest, where we’ll be representing 10up at WordCamp Chicago. Not only are we excited to both be on semi-familiar stomping grounds, but we’ll be bringing you two brand new talks! Zack will be presenting “<a title="Permalink to Grokking the WordPress Object Cache: Getting a Handle on the WP_Object_Cache Class" href="http://2012.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/grokking-the-wordpress-object-cache-getting-a-handle-on-the-wp_object_cache-class/" rel="bookmark">Grokking the WordPress Object Cache: Getting a Handle on the WP_Object_Cache Class</a>“, an absolute must for developers and anybody else who cares about performance or the deeper innards of WordPress. I will be giving a talk entitled “<a title="Permalink to How to Sneak Your Way Into Being a Rockstar WordPress Developer When Everyone Thinks You’re a Designer" href="http://2012.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-sneak-your-way-into-being-a-rockstar-wordpress-developer-when-everyone-thinks-youre-a-designer/" rel="bookmark">How to Sneak Your Way Into Being a Rockstar WordPress Developer When Everyone Thinks You’re a Designer</a>“, which, despite ironically being in the designer track, is about how I got involved with contributing to WordPress and how you can, too, whether or not you’re a developer-type. We’re excited to be at DePaul in the beautiful neighborhood of Lincoln Park, and we hope to see you there!</p>

Judging by the communication so far with speakers and attendees, this looks to be an incredibly well organized and planned camp. If you’re headed to Albuquerque, be sure to say hi this weekend!</p>

<p>Have you ever asked your web developer to open a link in a new tab or window? Generally, this is accomplished by adding a&nbsp;<code>target="_blank"</code>&nbsp;attribute to a link. <strong>Let’s consider the usability implications</strong>.</p>
<p>The rationale is almost always founded in a desire to keep the audience engaged with your content longer, or a concern about usability (for example, keeping the reader losing his or her bearings). The overwhelming finding from user experience researchers*, however, is that new windows/tabs should be avoided when simply opening new web pages. However, there are some appropriate use cases: opening a non-HTML document (web page) like a large image, video, audio, or other media, or to avoid interrupting an important linear process like a checkout. Even with these exceptions, however, there are &nbsp;friendlier alternatives like tool-tips and lightboxes.</p>
<p>In fact, the <code>target=""</code> attribute was actually deprecated (being phased out) from the HTML specifications until HTML5. As of HTML5, the W3C guidelines stipulate that it is no longer deprecated because it is deemed “useful in Web applications, e.g. in conjunction with iframe.”</p>

<p>Last weekend I had a blast attending <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a>, the original and largest WordCamp. For the price of one incredibly cheap entry ticket (well, plus travel from my home base in Washington DC…), I saw interesting speakers, ate great food, met friendly people, listened to live jazz, and was given complimentary WordPress gear. The conference was filled with WordPress users, enthusiasts, developers, and everyday people who just wanted to learn more about the platform, bonded by an affection and appreciation for the open-source WordPress project.&nbsp;Tied in with our annual company meeting, all of team 10up was flown into San Francisco for the purpose of attending the WordCamp and having some time for team bonding.</p>

<p>The most anticipated WordCamp event was, of course, Matt Mullenweg’s “State of the Word” – a light-hearted expression of his aspirations for and reflections on the current and future state of WordPress. As a web developer and plugin maker, Matt’s thoughts on unit tests for plugins stood out. Matt underscored the importance of elevating the quality of plugins in the official repository; units tests would be a great way to start this process off.</p>

<p>At 10up, quality and customer service is number one. 10up’s President is a core WordPress contributor with over a dozen top rated plug-ins to his name. Understanding what it means to build a high quality web solution goes all the way to the top.

No fewer than five of 10up’s employees are credited core WordPress contributors, more than any other agency in the program – with more on the way.</p>

<p>This weekend is the biggest WordPress event of the year – <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a>. So where else would team 10up be? No, we’re not just sending a couple of executives or a few top developers – you’ll find all of team 10up at this annual anchor event, running around in our 10up gear. At 10up, WordCamp San Francisco is our annual anchor, so we’ll be heading down the day before and sticking around for a couple of days after the camp for some face to face team work and some on site visits with local clients. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p><a href="http://2012.boston.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Boston 2012</a> occurred on a hot and steamy weekend on July 14 &amp; 15 at Boston University.</p>
<p>My WordCamp experience started with a vibrant <a title="WordPress Can Do That" href="http://www.slideshare.net/jessjurick/wordpress-can-do-that-13154220">presentation by our own Jess Jurick</a> on some lesser trumpeted capabilities that WordPress offers. She covered some of her favorite plugins such as Gravity Forms, WooCommerce and BuddyPress while showcasing some sites that push the boundaries of WordPress far beyond blogging.</p>
<p>Sam Hotchkiss offered attendees another atypical take on WordPress with <em>Using WordPress as a Web App Framework</em>. If you have an idea for an app, you can produce that interactive, secure, desktop-like program using WordPress! Features like user support, admin management, security, rapid deployment and many other essential requirements of app development are all part of WP’s framework.</p>

<p>It’s WordCamp season for 10up! Well, actually, are always&nbsp;traveling to various WordCamps, but in the next few months we’ve got a few. Near to my heart is&nbsp;<a title="2012 WordCamp Portland" href="http://2012.portland.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Portland</a>, rapidly approaching on August 18th. We have four 10uppers attending, two are featured speakers, and 10up is a <strong>top-tier, Bald Eagle sponsor</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5195 alignright" title="wc-pdx" src="./Blog _ 10up_files/wc-pdx-e1343711189328-300x94.png" alt="" width="300" height="94"></p>
<p>The three 10up Portlanders: Zack, Taylor, and Jeremy will be there and, since it’s our hometown, we will be volunteering throughout the day. Among the 12 selected to be featured speakers are Zack and Taylor. Presenting development anti-patterns&nbsp;is Zack, with his session titled&nbsp;<em>_doing_it_wrong: Improving Your Development Skills Through Examining Bad Practices</em>. Taylor is presenting a talk about how we, as authors, designers, and developers, should focus our attention on the interaction between users and content. His talk, titled&nbsp;<em>Why We Click Publish: Advocating for User-Centricity through Interaction Design</em>, as well as Zack’s are&nbsp;<a title="2012 WordCamp Portland Schedule" href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org/schedule/">scheduled simultaneously</a>, first thing after the morning announcements.</p>
<p>Because 25% of 10up employees call Portland home, 10up is sponsoring WordCamp Portland as a top-tier, Bald Eagle sponsor and Jake is flying in to keep tabs on us. If you’re in town for WordCamp, we’d love to meet you: find us in our grey 10up shirts or better yet, attend one of our sessions.</p>

<p>Before I move from Wichita back to the East Coast (my original home) in a couple of weeks, I’m going to meet the fine folks of the Kansas City WordPress MeetUp and reprise my WCNYC talk on “Making Custom Content Management Disappear into the WordPress Admin”, since I wasn’t able to speak at WordCamp Kansas City. We’ll be meeting at 1PM at OfficePort (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/wordpresskc/events/69018942/">details</a>). If you’re in the area, please come join&nbsp;us!</p>

<p>Here are my slides from <a title="WordCamp Orange County: Enterprise Class WordPress" href="https://10up.com/blog/2012/05/wordcamp-orange-county-enterprise-class-wordpress/"><em>Enterprise Class WordPress</em></a> – a talk I debuted <a href="http://2012.oc.wordcamp.org/session/enterprise-class-wordpress/">at WordCamp Orange County</a> last weekend. Like <em><a title="What Would Core Do?" href="https://10up.com/blog/2012/02/what-would-core-do/">What Would Core Do?</a></em>, the focus was on big ideas, not code. I found this difficult to formulate, largely because it involves a complex “problem” that’s more human than technical, and as such, requires a lot of generalizing. I do think that the underlying ideas are important to WordPress’s growth, and I’d like to see the conversation percolate. I plan to refine the talk and explore this with other communities and at other camps – <a href="http://2012.boston.wordcamp.org/speakers/#jake-goldman">starting with Boston</a>. Please chime in with ideas!</p>

<p>In an unexpected, but certainly delightful turn of events, I will be speaking at WordCamp Milwaukee next weekend! As some of you may or may not know, my family is from Milwaukee and I lived there for a few years, so I’m really excited to not only attend, but speak at the city’s inaugural WordCamp.</p>
<p>WordCamp Milwaukee will consist of three tracks: User, Developer, and Unconference. I’ll be speaking in the User track and delivering my “WordPress Can Do That” presentation. My talk will focus on showcasing some of the amazing sites running WordPress, profiling unique front-end user experiences and the custom backend publishing interfaces that make managing these sites a breeze.</p>
<p>If you’re in the area or plan on attending the event, feel free to ping me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/jessjurick">@jessjurick</a>) if you’d like to meet up!</p>

<p>The WordCamp Seattle organizers had great foresight when they chose last weekend for their 2012 event at the Seattle Art Museum. Not only did everything turn out perfect, from the weather to the venue, but 10up’s entire Portland contingent was able to make the trip.</p>
<p>We had an excellent time mingling and meeting likeminded folks and were impressed with the quality of sessions offered in all three tracks. I think the only regret is we weren’t able to attend them all.</p>

<p>In Jake’s presentation, he will be asking:&nbsp;<a href="http://2012.nyc.wordcamp.org/session/what-would-core-do-extending-with-class-and-consistency/">“What would core do?”</a>, and challenging you to keep asking yourself the same as you add your themes and plugins to WordPress. He will show you how to extend core “with class and consistency”.</p>
<p>Helen will be talking about:&nbsp;<a href="http://2012.nyc.wordcamp.org/session/making-plugins-and-themes-disappear-into-the-wordpress-admin/">“Making Plugins and Themes Disappear into the WordPress Admin.</a>&nbsp;One of the best things about WordPress is its beautiful admin UI.” Helen suggests, “We should take advantage of what is built-in and also strive to have our additions look as though they are native.”</p>
<p>I will&nbsp;be talking about: <a href="http://2012.nyc.wordcamp.org/session/actions-and-filters-in-core-javascript-hooked-on-javascript-works-for-me/">Actions and Filters in Core JavaScript.</a> As JavaScript becomes an ever more important part of the WordPress admin, knowing how to use these JavaScript hooks will become as essential as knowing PHP hooks.</p>
<p>If you are in the New York area, come see us. We would look forward to meeting you (or seeing you again).</p>

<p>About a month ago, Jane Wells posted surveys for various WordPress contributor groups, including <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/organizing-our-contributor-groups/">one for core code contributors on wpdevel</a>, in an effort to begin getting them more organized and select team representatives. I’m very excited to have been <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/team-reps/">chosen as one for the core contributors group</a>. We’ll be aiming to have regular cross-group chats and an in-person summit sometime in the near future. This is very exciting, not just for those of us representing the various groups, but for the community at large. Some of the things that I know I’m looking forward to are more communication and collaboration across groups (e.g. UI and accessibility, core development and documentation) and encouraging more people to contribute in whichever way suits them as the WordPress ecosystem continues to grow.</p>

<p>Having taken the “fine-tuning administration” series as far as I can go (<em><a title="Customizing WordPress Admin – updated for 3.1 with new tips!" href="https://10up.com/blog/2011/03/customizing-wordpress-admin/">Hijacking WordPress Admin</a></em>,&nbsp;<em><a title="Editing WordPress’s Visual Editor" href="https://10up.com/blog/2011/12/editing-wordpress-tinymce-visual-editor/">Editing the Visual Editor</a></em>,&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://10up.com/blog/2012/02/what-would-core-do/">What Would Core Do?</a></em>),&nbsp;I’m turning my attention to another topic that’s near and dear to me: WordPress as an enterprise caliber content management solution.</p>
<p>There’s no question that WordPress has won the hearts and minds of the publishing industry, with everyone from the New York Times to TechCrunch embracing the platform. And WordPress is used by many huge business organizations, non-profits, and government entities – but usually, for microsites, a blog, or another “piece” of their publishing solution. WordPress still faces resistance from many big institutions in many verticals when it comes to that “enterprise CMS” need – the content management system that’s at the core of the organization’s online presence.</p>
<p>At 10up, we’ve had some big successes helping large organizations adopt WordPress as their central CMS, but we’ve also seen huge prospective opportunities ultimately shy away because of lingering hesitations about WordPress’s suitability to the enterprise class title. Some of the concerns are legitimate worries about its functional suitability to issues that only concern huge, international entities. Other concerns are more organizational – can huge companies use a CMS owned and managed by an open source “community”? Is WordPress a CMS meant for the million dollar project?</p>

<p>On May 19th, <a href="http://2012.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/theres-a-function-for-that-doing-more-for-less-with-core-functions/">I will be speaking at WordCamp Seattle</a>. My talk is entitled: “There’s a Function for That: Doing More for Less with Core Functions”. It is exciting to have the opportunity to geek out about some of the hidden gems in WordPress Core.</p>
<p>I plan to curate a plethora of interesting, obscure and powerful WordPress functions to give them the attention and love that they need. Drawing from my experience with complex WordPress projects, I will introduce developers to exciting WordPress functions. WordPress Core has had so many brilliant developers contribute to it. Part of those contributions have led to an extensive catalog of powerful functions that are waiting to make developer’s lives easier. I hope to shed light on these functions to make developer’s work more agile, allow developers to do things the “WordPress way,” and help contribute to the cannon of poetic code in the world.</p>

<p>WordPress’ cron implementation is a powerful tool for scheduling events in WordPress projects. Its usefulness at times is only matched by the frustration inherent in debugging issues with cron. After my most recent frustrations implementing a WordPress scheduled event, I decided to build <a title="Debug Bar Cron" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar-cron/" target="_blank">Debug Bar Cron</a>, an extension for the fantastic <a title="Debug Bar" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar/" target="_blank">Debug Bar</a> that adds a panel of information about registered events. With 10up teammate Helen Hou-Sandi’s UI love, this plugin helps you easily visualize all of the WordPress scheduled events information to quickly see what is happening with these events.</p>
<p>The plugin focuses on providing developers with the most pertinent information regarding their scheduled events as easily as possible. The “dashboard” shows how many events are scheduled, whether or not WordPress cron ran on the current request, when the next event is scheduled to occur, and the current time for easy comparison for the event times.</p>

<p>At 10up, responsive design is a hot request. In fact, over the course of the last year, we’ve seen this type of work evolve from relative indifference – when pitched – to a common client expectation.</p>
<p>It often makes sense to release a new “desktop” experience before rolling CSS3 media queries or other responsive techniques. Furthermore, you might invest in contextual layout for phone screens, but leave the “desktop” experience for tablet devices. While devices like an iPad or iPhone do a great job of rendering any web page (this was the original selling point!), there are cases where the layout calls for subtle changes. In one case, we needed to hide buttons that spawned unsupported technologies (e.g. Flash) on iOS devices. We also had to deal with a subtle but ugly <a href="http://www.billrobbinsdesign.com/fixing-background-image-sizing-in-ios/">iOS Safari quirk involving large background images</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy enough to write server side code&nbsp;(e.g. PHP) that changes the output based on the browser’s user agent, but if you need to work with page caching, <em>server side</em> code based on visitor specific properties isn’t an option.</p>
<p><strong>The following simple JavaScript code snippet will add a “browser-ios” class to your body tag</strong> that will allow you to easily tweak elements with basic CSS, and without any server side concerns like page caching.</p>

</p>
<p>I am privileged to have the opportunity to talk about caching for WordPress sites during <a href="http://2012.sandiego.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Diego 2012</a>. My talk, titled “Caching for Coders: How, What and When to Cache in WordPress”, will introduce WordPress developers to core concepts for deploying successful caching strategies in WordPress. There will be an emphasis on getting rid of a “cookie cutter” approach to caching design patterns in favor of building caching patterns that fit the needs of&nbsp; specific WordPress sites. I am most excited to discuss the often neglected topic of “when” to cache in WordPress projects. Not all caching strategies are created equal and I will be addressing some of the more successful caching approaches inspired by my work at 10up LLC.</p>
<p>This talk also gives me the opportunity to try out a new model for developing slides for a presentation. I am using HTML5 slides, which I am managing on a <a title="Caching for Coders Repo" href="https://github.com/tollmanz/caching-for-coders">GitHub repo</a>. Hosting these slides on GitHub allows me to effectively “open-source” the talk. Having GitHub as the center of development and discussion of these slides will allow others to contribute to the talk and hopefully let it evolve over time. Who knows what will happen, but I am excited for the potential that this idea has.</p>

<p>Are you a tech-savvy, self-motivated marketing professional, or recent college graduate, with a passion for using online and offline tools to help companies better market their services and convert prospects into clients? Then you might be a great fit for 10up’s new Marketing Coordinator role! As Marketing Coordinator, you will be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling introduction meetings with prospective new clients</li>
<li>Preparing one-page briefs on new project opportunities that will inform initial conversations with prospects</li>
<li>Developing lead generation channels to expand our prospective client pool</li>
<li>Collaborating with the strategy team to prepare proposals for new project opportunities</li>
<li>Maintaining, updating, and creating content for our website, including client case studies and blog posts</li>
<li>Building a content strategy for 10up’s Facebook and Twitter presences and managing interactions on those platforms</li>
<li>Preparing client status and billing reports</li>
<li>Managing basic operational tasks, including scheduling team trips and preparing monthly client invoices</li>
</ul>
<p>While prior experience is great, enthusiasm and the ability to learn quickly on your feet will serve as great substitutes for experience. As with all of our positions, the Marketing Coordinator’s scope of responsibilities is expected to evolve over time, so you should have the willingness to be flexible and pitch in where needed. Ideally, after an initial training period, the person who fills this role will have the opportunity to take on more senior marketing and project management responsibilities, so excellent communication (both written and verbal) and organizational skills are required.</p>
<p>We envision the Marketing Coordinator position as a full-time role, but applicants seeking part-time work will also be considered. 10up is a distributed company, so you will have the opportunity to work from home, which is just one of the many perks we offer our employees!</p>
<p>Think you’re ready to join team 10up and help us grow our business? Then send your resume, cover letter, and three references to <a href="mailto:jake@get10up.com" target="_blank">jake<code>@</code>get10up.com</a>.</p>

Presented in the “Think Tank” track, it explores some ideas and concepts that underlie change in web development medium, and introduces coding techniques for the last HTML5 / CSS3 capabilities. Here’s the description from the WordCamp schedule:</p>
<p><em>We’ve all probably heard of HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, and other “future of the web” buzzwords. Maybe you’ve even dabbled in HTML5 doctype declarations and “header” tags, or used CSS3 rounded corners or gradients. But most of us have only scratched the surface of these technologies, and for good reason – not everyone is using Chrome 16 or Firefox 9 yet, and even they haven’t settled on uniform implementations. We’ll look at how Responsive Design is already beginning to change the way we approach building sites for different screen sizes, and peak into potentially transformative HTML5 techniques that are only beginning to appear around the web.</em></p>

Or, <em>What Would Core Do</em>? Yesterday, at WordCamp Miami, I finally debuted a talk that I had been thinking about for some time. I see WWCD as the third and capstone talk in my “extending WordPress administration” series, and it’s my favorite of the set.</p>
<p>The series began in 2010 at Chicago with “Hijacking WordPress Admin” – one of the first talks to focus on hooks and techniques to generally tailor the administrative panel to individual clients. You can only fit so much into a talk, so rather than focus on good user interface, I focused on sometimes over the top examples to illustrate the idea that the admin panel is actually remarkably flexible. After a few repeats at different WordCamps, I used WordCamp Chicago 2011 to debut the second in the series: “Editing the Visual Editor.” This time, the focus was solely on methods to customize the visual editor and refine the writing experience – the place where publishers spend most of their time.</p>
<p>The capstone talk is the lightest on code (two quick slides at the end). Rather, it gets back to the <em>philosophy</em> of extending WordPress administration, and challenges plug-in and theme authors to “do better.” It’s a fun look at some terrible plug-in practices, with a serious underlying point: when you build on WordPress, do you think about how the core development team would approach the problem?</p>
<p>We’ll hopefully have the video from WordPress.tv soon, as well.</p>

I consider this a “sequel” to a broader talk on <a title="Editing WordPress Admin" href="https://www.10up.com/blog/2011/03/customizing-wordpress-admin/">editing the WordPress administrative experience</a> that I like to think I pioneered in 2010 at a few WordCamps, including Chicago and Mid-Alantic, which several new speakers now seem to be running with.</p>
<p>WordPress’s visual content editor (<a href="https://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a>) is, in many ways, at the heart of WordPress’s content management experience. It’s where editors spend most of their time, and where content is crafted to appear on the front end of your site. Like most of WordPress, the editor can be customized to be both more powerful and more specific to the needs of an individual site or client. This presentation covers topics including custom editor stylesheets based on post type, modifying and removing buttons from the editor, and even creating your own custom buttons for the TinyMCE toolbar. It even covers brand new WordPress 3.3 techniques introduced with the new <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor"><em>wp_editor</em></a> function.</p>

<p>None-the-less, if you’re looking for an overview of content management concepts applied to WordPress, you can find them here. I’ve uploaded the slideshow as a video to YouTube (to preserve its feel); the video moves quickly, so you might have to be quick on the pause button!</p>

<p>As much as we like giving back to the community, it’s often hard to find time to keep some of the more sophisticated plug-ins up to date. One plug-in that hasn’t been updated in some time that I am frequently asked about is Secondary HTML Content.</p>
<p>I’ve had a number of ambitious goals for 3.0 for some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable a more complete editor experience (notably, Visual / HTML tabs)</li>
<li>Allow users to customize the labels for each content block</li>
<li>Add support for custom post types (not just posts and pages)</li>
<li>Remove arbitrary limit of 5 editor blocks</li>
<li>Integrate the settings with the “Writing” settings page (a logical place for them; I’m make a conscious effort with my themes and plug-ins to not “clutter” the settings panel)</li>
<li>On top of all this, provide a seamless upgrade path for 2.0 users</li>
</ul>
<p>The first bullet has been by far the most challenging. While WordPress has a number of core functions that simplify adding a visual editor, they simply weren’t built with <em>multiple</em> editors on one page in mind. For the technically savvy, there are many hardcoded ID attributes, interacting with both CSS and JavaScript that rely on those IDs. As we know, the DOM is not intended to have multiple elements with identical IDs (particularly when we’re hooking events with JavaScript).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I’m excited to say that the biggest hurdles have been tackled. Since we can’t work on hobby projects full time, the release is probably at least a couple of weeks out, mostly having to do with the upgrade path code.</p>

<p>At the heart of the talk was a simple &nbsp;Twenty-Ten child theme, with the focal point being a&nbsp;<em>functions.php</em> file loaded to the gills with hooks and functions that customize the branding and administrative experience (available for download here).</p>
<p><strong>I’ve updated the child theme to 1.5</strong>; in addition to incorporating some suggestions, I’ve updated some small bits (like removing menu items) to take advantage of new WordPress 3.1 API calls and some other best practices (it now <strong>requires WordPress 3.1</strong>).</p>

As a user of WordPress, he was dismayed but not surprised to hear Acquia dismiss another attendee’s questions about WordPress’s viability as a content management system. “If you want a blog, go with WordPress. If you want a real website, go with Drupal.”</p>
<p>I have nothing against Drupal. In fact, I’ve developed websites on Drupal, and have recommended Drupal for some truly atypical and complex website projects. That said, I maintain that WordPress is not just a <em>capable </em>CMS for 90% of websites, but today, it’s the better choice. It’s usability is second to none, and with lower setup costs, hosting requirements, and maintenance requirements, it’s a smarter choice for the average client’s wallet. With the fairly recent addition of features like custom post types, custom taxonomies, and built in menu management, WordPress is quickly closing the gap on that 10% “unsuitability” hole, too.</p>
<p>You can’t blame Acquia for trying to protect their business, but it is a bit sad to see serious companies perpetuating the myth. For those still in doubt, I’ve attached my presentation from my “That’s a WordPress site??” lightning talk from July of last year.</p>

<p>The origin of the series actually dated back to January’s WordCamp Boston, where Jeff moderated a panel I organized called “Monetization in a Free World”, intended to help the audience understand the commercial WordPress themes, plug-ins, and SaaS businesses. Jeff ended up being in an impossible position, with 40 minutes to cover all 3 models and incorporate Automattic’s perspective, visa vi Jane Wells. Jeff and I decided it was worth doing justice to the <em>idea</em>; and so the April series of podcast episodes came to life.</p>

<p>I will be talking WordPress at two upcoming events, on opposite ends of the U.S. east coast this month.</p>
<p><strong>WordCamp Miami</strong>. Never a big fan of winter, I’m definitely looking forward to a breather in sunny Miami, Florida. I’m flying down the evening before (this Friday, the 19th) and returning the following Tuesday. It’s actually more economic to stay a couple of extra days at the hotel as compared with taking a Sunday flight back. In any case, <a href="http://wordcampmia.com/speakers/">I’ll be speaking</a> at <a href="http://www.wordcampmia.com/">Miami’s WordCamp</a>, which takes place on Saturday the 20th at the University of Miami. I’ll be presenting a revised version of <a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2034-themes-101">Themes 101, which “premiered” at WordCamp Boston</a>. It will incorporate new information on the upcoming “default” theme, along with some feedback from Boston. If you’re in the area and interested in meeting up on Sunday or Monday, send me a note.</p>
<p><strong>Boston North Shore Web Geeks’ </strong><strong>“Great CMS Debate”.</strong> I’ll be representing WordPress on a <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/539248908">panel debating the merits of a few popular web content management systems</a> (CMS). Other panelists include Boston Web Studio’s Marc Amos (<a href="http://expressionengine.com/">Expression Engine</a>), Jay Batson (co-founder of Acquia, a widely known <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> consultancy), and Fidelity’s Tom Herer (representing <a href="http://kentico.com/">Kentico</a>). My friend, founder of WordCamp Boston, and strategy guru at Optaros, <a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/">John Eckman</a>, moderates. It takes place on February 25th, at 7 ,pm in Newburyport, Massachusetts.</p>

I spent about 10 minutes presenting my <a href="https://www.cmurrayconsulting.com/software/google-reader-shared-wordpress/">Google Reader plug-in</a>, had a <a href="https://wordcampboston.com/2010/01/06/thats-all-she-wrote-wordcamp-boston-sells-out-again/">kick off WordCamp Boston planning meeting</a>, had the pleasure of <a href="https://blog.afterthedeadline.com/2009/11/16/the-ten-people-you-meet-at-wordcamp-nyc/">meeting inspiring folks like Raffi Mudge</a>, and even had a great conversation in the hallway with <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="https://www.wptavern.com/">Jeff Chandler</a> (me in the&nbsp; middle with the shoulder&nbsp; bag, Matt sitting to my left, Jeff to my right – photo courtesy John Eckman) for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>One of the sessions I attended was Ramil Teodosio’s <em>WordPress Powered-Intranets</em>. I’ve done a few Intranet implementations of my own and Ramil’s seminar was a bit more focused on SharePoint-like substitution than I expected. My own experience gave me an opportunity to pipe up a couple of times to offer suggestions and, among other things, plug my free <a href="https://www.cmurrayconsulting.com/software/wordpress-restricted-site-access/">Restricted Site Access plug-in</a>, which was born out of an Intranet project, and I thought might be of interest to the audience. Judging by the post-presentation follow-up with a handful of attendees, at least a few found my comments useful.</p>
